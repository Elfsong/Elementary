lp+ss: 0-dimensional biomaterials lack inductive properties. <s0> objective the effects of hydroxyethyl starch on bleeding after cardiopulmonary bypass were determined.  <s1> methods a meta-analysis was performed of postoperative blood loss in randomized clinical trials of hydroxyethyl starch versus albumin for fluid management in adult cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. <s2> impacts of hydroxyethyl starch molecular weight and molar substitution were assessed. <s3> randomized trials directly comparing different hydroxyethyl starch solutions were also included.  <s4> results eighteen trials with 970 total patients were included. <s5> compared with albumin, hydroxyethyl starch increased postoperative blood loss by 33.3% of a pooled sd (95% confidence interval, 18.2%-48.3%; p < .001). <s6> risk of reoperation for bleeding was more than doubled by hydroxyethyl starch (relative risk, 2.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-4.40; p = .020). <s7> hydroxyethyl starch increased transfusion of red blood cells by 28.4% of a pooled sd (95% confidence interval, 12.2%-44.6%; p < .001), of fresh-frozen plasma by 30.6% (95% confidence interval, 8.0%-53.1%; p = .008), and of platelets by 29.8% (95% confidence interval, 3.4%-56.2%; p = .027). <s8> none of these effects differed significantly between hydroxyethyl starch 450/0.7 and 200/0.5. <s9> insufficient data were available for hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 versus albumin; however, no significant differences were detected in head-to-head comparisons of hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 with 200/0.5. <s10> albumin improved hemodynamics. <s11> there were no differences in fluid balance, ventilator time, intensive care unit stay, or mortality.  <s12> conclusions hydroxyethyl starch increased blood loss, reoperation for bleeding, and blood product transfusion after cardiopulmonary bypass. <s13> there was no evidence that these risks could be mitigated by lower molecular weight and substitution.

lp+ss: 1 in 5 million in UK have abnormal PrP positivity. <s0> bacteria such as escherichia coli will often consume one sugar at a time when fed multiple sugars, in a process known as carbon catabolite repression. <s1> the classic example involves glucose and lactose, where e. coli will first consume glucose, and only when it has consumed all of the glucose will it begin to consume lactose. <s2> in addition to that of lactose, glucose also represses the consumption of many other sugars, including arabinose and xylose. <s3> in this work, we characterized a second hierarchy in e. coli, that between arabinose and xylose. <s4> we show that, when grown in a mixture of the two pentoses, e. coli will consume arabinose before it consumes xylose. <s5> consistent with a mechanism involving catabolite repression, the expression of the xylose metabolic genes is repressed in the presence of arabinose. <s6> we found that this repression is arac dependent and involves a mechanism where arabinose-bound arac binds to the xylose promoters and represses gene expression. <s7> collectively, these results demonstrate that sugar utilization in e. coli involves multiple layers of regulation, where cells will consume first glucose, then arabinose, and finally xylose. <s8> these results may be pertinent in the metabolic engineering of e. coli strains capable of producing chemical and biofuels from mixtures of hexose and pentose sugars derived from plant biomass. 
lp+ss: 1-1% of colorectal cancer patients are diagnosed with regional or distant metastases. <s0> the autoimmune regulator (aire) plays a critical role in central tolerance by promoting the display of tissue-specific antigens in the thymus. <s1> to study the influence of aire on thymic selection in a physiological setting, we used tetramer reagents to detect autoreactive t cells specific for the aire-dependent tissue-specific antigen interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (irbp), in the polyclonal repertoire. <s2> two class ii tetramer reagents were designed to identify t cells specific for two different peptide epitopes of irbp. <s3> analyses of the polyclonal t-cell repertoire showed a high frequency of activated t cells specific for both irbp tetramers in aire(-/-) mice, but not in aire(+/+) mice. <s4> surprisingly, although one tetramer-binding t-cell population was efficiently deleted in the thymus in an aire-dependent manner, the second tetramer-binding population was not deleted and could be detected in both the aire(-/-) and aire(+/+) t-cell repertoires. <s5> we found that aire-dependent thymic deletion of irbp-specific t cells relies on intercellular transfer of irbp between thymic stroma and bone marrow-derived antigen-presenting cells. <s6> furthermore, our data suggest that aire-mediated deletion relies not only on thymic expression of irbp, but also on proper antigen processing and presentation of irbp by thymic antigen-presenting cells. 
lp+ss: 10% of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) deaths happen in newborns aged less than 6 months. <s0> the molecular basis for the distinctive cytokine expression of cd4+ t helper 1 (th1) and t helper 2 (th2) subsets remains elusive. <s1> here, we report that the proto-oncogene c-maf, a basic region/leucine zipper transcription factor, controls tissue-specific expression of il-4. <s2> c-maf is expressed in th2 but not th1 clones and is induced during normal precursor cell differentiation along a th2 but not th1 lineage. <s3> c-maf binds to a c-maf response element (mare) in the proximal il-4 promoter adjacent to a site footprinted by extracts from th2 but not th1 clones. <s4> ectopic expression of c-maf transactivates the il-4 promoter in th1 cells, b cells, and nonlymphoid cells, a function that maps to the mare and th2-specific footprint. <s5> furthermore, c-maf acts in synergy with the nuclear factor of activated t cells (nf-atp) to initiate endogeneous il-4 production by b cells. <s6> manipulation of c-maf may alter th subset ratios in human disease.

lp+ss: 4-PBA treatment raises endoplasmic reticulum stress in response to general endoplasmic reticulum stress markers. <s0> endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress causes pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and contributes to β-cell loss and the progression of type 2 diabetes. <s1> wolfram syndrome 1 (wfs1) has been shown to be an important regulator of the er stress signalling pathway; however, its role in β-cell function remains unclear. <s2> here we provide evidence that wfs1 is essential for glucose- and glucagon-like peptide 1 (glp-1)-stimulated cyclic amp production and regulation of insulin biosynthesis and secretion. <s3> stimulation with glucose causes wfs1 translocation from the er to the plasma membrane, where it forms a complex with adenylyl cyclase 8 (ac8), an essential camp-generating enzyme in the β-cell that integrates glucose and glp-1 signalling. <s4> er stress and mutant wfs1 inhibit complex formation and activation of ac8, reducing camp synthesis and insulin secretion. <s5> these findings reveal that an er-stress-related protein has a distinct role outside the er regulating both insulin biosynthesis and secretion. <s6> the reduction of wfs1 protein on the plasma membrane during er stress is a contributing factor for β-cell dysfunction and progression of type 2 diabetes.

lp+ss: 40mg/day dosage of folic acid and 2mg/day dosage of vitamin B12 does not affect chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. <s0> prions cause transmissible spongiform encephalopathies for which no treatment exists. <s1> prions consist of prpsc, a misfolded and aggregated form of the cellular prion protein (prpc). <s2> we explore the antiprion properties of luminescent conjugated polythiophenes (lcps) that bind and stabilize ordered protein aggregates. <s3> by administering a library of structurally diverse lcps to the brains of prion-infected mice via osmotic minipumps, we found that antiprion activity required a minimum of five thiophene rings bearing regularly spaced carboxyl side groups. <s4> solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance analyses and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that anionic side chains interacted with complementary, regularly spaced cationic amyloid residues of model prions. <s5> these findings allowed us to extract structural rules governing the interaction between lcps and protein aggregates, which we then used to design a new set of lcps with optimized binding. <s6> the new set of lcps showed robust prophylactic and therapeutic potency in prion-infected mice, with the lead compound extending survival by >80% and showing activity against both mouse and hamster prions as well as efficacy upon intraperitoneal administration into mice. <s7> these results demonstrate the feasibility of targeted chemical design of compounds that may be useful for treating diseases of aberrant protein aggregation such as prion disease. 
lp+ss: 5'-nucleotidase metabolizes 6MP. <s0> relapsed childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all) carries a poor prognosis, despite intensive retreatment, owing to intrinsic drug resistance. <s1> the biological pathways that mediate resistance are unknown. <s2> here, we report the transcriptome profiles of matched diagnosis and relapse bone marrow specimens from ten individuals with pediatric b-lymphoblastic leukemia using rna sequencing. <s3> transcriptome sequencing identified 20 newly acquired, novel nonsynonymous mutations not present at initial diagnosis, with 2 individuals harboring relapse-specific mutations in the same gene, nt5c2, encoding a 5'-nucleotidase. <s4> full-exon sequencing of nt5c2 was completed in 61 further relapse specimens, identifying additional mutations in 5 cases. <s5> enzymatic analysis of mutant proteins showed that base substitutions conferred increased enzymatic activity and resistance to treatment with nucleoside analog therapies. <s6> clinically, all individuals who harbored nt5c2 mutations relapsed early, within 36 months of initial diagnosis (p = 0.03). <s7> these results suggest that mutations in nt5c2 are associated with the outgrowth of drug-resistant clones in all. 
lp+ss: 5'-nucleotidase metabolizes 6MP. <s0> the ino80 atpase is a member of the snf2 family of atpases and functions as an integral component of a multisubunit atp-dependent chromatin remodeling complex. <s1> although ino80 complexes from yeast and higher eukaryotes share a common core of conserved subunits, the complexes have diverged substantially during evolution and have acquired new subunits with apparently species-specific functions. <s2> recent studies have shown that the ino80 complex contributes to a wide variety of chromatin-dependent nuclear transactions, including transcription, dna repair and dna replication. 
lp+ss: 50% of patients exposed to radiation have activated markers of mesenchymal stem cells. <s0> despite its key role in determining the stability and intensity of malaria transmission, the infectiousness of human populations to mosquitoes has rarely been estimated. <s1> field-based analyses of malaria transmission have frequently relied on the prevalence of asexual parasites or gametocytes as proxies for infectiousness. <s2> we now summarize empirical data on human infectiousness from africa and papua new guinea. <s3> over a wide range of transmission intensities there is little relationship between the infectiousness of human populations to vector mosquitoes and mosquito-to-human transmission intensity. <s4> we compare these data with the predictions of a stochastic simulation model of plasmodium falciparum epidemiology. <s5> this model predicted little variation in the infectiousness of the human population for entomologic inoculation rates (eirs) greater than approximately 10 infectious bites per year, demonstrating that the lack of relationship between the eir and the infectious reservoir can be explained without invoking any effects of acquired transmission-blocking immunity. <s6> the near absence of field data from areas with an eir < 10 per year precluded validation of the model predictions for low eir values. <s7> these results suggest that interventions reducing mosquito-to-human transmission will have little or no effect on human infectiousness at the levels of transmission found in most rural areas of sub-saharan africa. <s8> unless very large reductions in transmission can be achieved, measures to prevent mosquito-to-human transmission need to be complemented with interventions that reduce the density or infectiousness of blood stage parasites. 
lp+ss: 61% of colorectal cancer patients are diagnosed with regional or distant metastases. <s0> micrornas are proposed to serve vital functions in the regulation of tumor progression and invasion. <s1> however, the expression levels of mir-203 in non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) and its clinical significance remain unknown. <s2> in the present study, the association between b-cell-specific moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (bmi1) and mir-203 was investigated. <s3> mir-203 was demonstrated to act as a tumor suppressor by regulating the expression of bmi1. <s4> mir-203 expression levels were downregulated in nsclc tissues while bmi1 expression was upregulated in nsclc tissues and cell lines. <s5> furthermore, downregulated bmi1 or enhanced mir-203 expression inhibited nsclc cell proliferation and invasion in vitro. <s6> in addition, a dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed, which identified bmi1 as a novel target of mir-203. <s7> in conclusion, the present study demonstrated that mir-203 functions as a tumor suppressor and is important in inhibiting the proliferation of nsclc cells through targeting bmi1. <s8> these findings indicate that mir-203 may be useful as a novel potential therapeutic target for nsclc. 
lp+ss: 7-day-old adult Caenorhabditis elegans exhibit approximately 5% of the learning capacity seen in 1-day old adults. <s0> of all the age-related declines, memory loss is one of the most devastating. <s1> while conditions that increase longevity have been identified, the effects of these longevity-promoting factors on learning and memory are unknown. <s2> here we show that the c. elegans insulin/igf-1 receptor mutant daf-2 improves memory performance early in adulthood and maintains learning ability better with age but, surprisingly, demonstrates no extension in long-term memory with age. <s3> by contrast, eat-2 mutants, a model of dietary restriction (dr), exhibit impaired long-term memory in young adulthood but maintain this level of memory longer with age. <s4> we find that crh-1, the c. elegans homolog of the creb transcription factor, is required for long-term associative memory, but not for learning or short-term memory. <s5> the expression of crh-1 declines with age and differs in the longevity mutants, and creb expression and activity correlate with memory performance. <s6> our results suggest that specific longevity treatments have acute and long-term effects on cognitive functions that decline with age through their regulation of rate-limiting genes required for learning and memory. 
lp+ss: 7-day-old adult Caenorhabditis elegans exhibit approximately 75% of the learning capacity seen in 1-day old adults. <s0> background birth size, perhaps a proxy for prenatal environment, might be a correlate of subsequent breast cancer risk, but findings from epidemiological studies have been inconsistent. <s1> we re-analysed individual participant data from published and unpublished studies to obtain more precise estimates of the magnitude and shape of the birth size-breast cancer association.  <s2> methods and findings studies were identified through computer-assisted and manual searches, and personal communication with investigators. <s3> individual participant data from 32 studies, comprising 22,058 breast cancer cases, were obtained. <s4> random effect models were used, if appropriate, to combine study-specific estimates of effect. <s5> birth weight was positively associated with breast cancer risk in studies based on birth records (pooled relative risk [rr] per one standard deviation [sd] [= 0.5 kg] increment in birth weight: 1.06; 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.02-1.09) and parental recall when the participants were children (1.02; 95% ci 0.99-1.05), but not in those based on adult self-reports, or maternal recall during the woman's adulthood (0.98; 95% ci 0.95-1.01) (p for heterogeneity between data sources = 0.003). <s6> relative to women who weighed 3.000-3.499 kg, the risk was 0.96 (ci 0.80-1.16) in those who weighed < 2.500 kg, and 1.12 (95% ci 1.00-1.25) in those who weighed > or = 4.000 kg (p for linear trend = 0.001) in birth record data. <s7> birth length and head circumference from birth records were also positively associated with breast cancer risk (pooled rr per one sd increment: 1.06 [95% ci 1.03-1.10] and 1.09 [95% ci 1.03-1.15], respectively). <s8> simultaneous adjustment for these three birth size variables showed that length was the strongest independent predictor of risk. <s9> the birth size effects did not appear to be confounded or mediated by established breast cancer risk factors and were not modified by age or menopausal status. <s10> the cumulative incidence of breast cancer per 100 women by age 80 y in the study populations was estimated to be 10.0, 10.0, 10.4, and 11.5 in those who were, respectively, in the bottom, second, third, and top fourths of the birth length distribution.  <s11> conclusions this pooled analysis of individual participant data is consistent with birth size, and in particular birth length, being an independent correlate of breast cancer risk in adulthood.

lp+ss: 90% of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) deaths happen in newborns aged less than 6 months. <s0> context chronic tension-type headaches are characterized by near-daily headaches and often are difficult to manage in primary practice. <s1> behavioral and pharmacological therapies each appear modestly effective, but data are lacking on their separate and combined effects.  <s2> objective to evaluate the clinical efficacy of behavioral and pharmacological therapies, singly and combined, for chronic tension-type headaches.  <s3> design and setting randomized placebo-controlled trial conducted from august 1995 to january 1998 at 2 outpatient sites in ohio.  <s4> participants two hundred three adults (mean age, 37 years; 76% women) with diagnosis of chronic tension-type headaches (mean, 26 headache d/mo).  <s5> interventions participants were randomly assigned to receive tricyclic antidepressant (amitriptyline hydrochloride, up to 100 mg/d, or nortriptyline hydrochloride, up to 75 mg/d) medication (n = 53), placebo (n = 48), stress management (eg, relaxation, cognitive coping) therapy (3 sessions and 2 telephone contacts) plus placebo (n = 49), or stress management therapy plus antidepressant medication (n = 53).  <s6> main outcome measures monthly headache index scores calculated as the mean of pain ratings (0-10 scale) recorded by participants in a daily diary 4 times per day; number of days per month with at least moderate pain (pain rating >/=5), analgesic medication use, and headache disability inventory scores, compared by intervention group.  <s7> results tricyclic antidepressant medication and stress management therapy each produced larger reductions in headache activity, analgesic medication use, and headache-related disability than placebo, but antidepressant medication yielded more rapid improvements in headache activity. <s8> combined therapy was more likely to produce clinically significant (>/=50%) reductions in headache index scores (64% of participants) than antidepressant medication (38% of participants; p =.006), stress management therapy (35%; p =.003), or placebo (29%; p =.001). <s9> on other measures the combined therapy and its 2 component therapies produced similar outcomes.  <s10> conclusions our results indicate that antidepressant medication and stress management therapy are each modestly effective in treating chronic tension-type headaches. <s11> combined therapy may improve outcome relative to monotherapy. 
lp+ss: A 100g dose of chloroquine chemoprophylactic regimen results in retinal toxicity after 1 year of weekly intake. <s0> context long-term travelers, defined here as those traveling for periods of 6 months or longer, face particular challenges regarding malaria prevention. <s1> current guidelines for malaria prevention primarily address prevention of plasmodium falciparum infections in short-term travelers.  <s2> objectives to examine the risk of malaria in long-term travelers, recent developments in personal protective measures, and the safety and tolerability of malaria chemoprophylaxis during long-term use and to consider prevention strategies including continuous chemoprophylaxis, stand-by emergency self-treatment, seasonal prophylaxis, and strategies to prevent primary infection and relapses from p vivax malaria.    <s3> evidence acquisition comprehensive search of scientific publications including medline via both ovid and pubmed for relevant studies and articles with a cutoff date of july 2006, using the search terms long-term travel and malaria prevention, long-term malaria chemoprophylaxis, and insect repellent and malaria. <s4> additional references were obtained from searching the bibliographies of the selected articles, from dissertations, and from the proceedings of relevant conferences on travel medicine. <s5> there were no language restrictions.    <s6> evidence synthesis long-term travelers have a higher risk of malaria than short-term travelers. <s7> long-term travelers underuse personal protective measures and adhere poorly to continuous chemoprophylaxis regimens. <s8> a number of strategies are used during long-term stays: discontinuation of chemoprophylaxis after the initial period, sequential regimens with different medications for chemoprophylaxis, stand-by emergency self-treatment, and seasonal chemoprophylaxis targeting high-incidence periods or locations. <s9> all strategies have advantages and drawbacks. <s10> counterfeit drugs sold in countries endemic for malaria pose serious concern for long-term travelers who purchase their medications overseas. <s11> vivax malaria causes significant illness in travelers, but relapses of vivax malaria are not prevented with the current first-line chemoprophylaxis regimens. <s12> consensus guidelines are needed for prevention of malaria in long-term travelers.  <s13> conclusions prevention of malaria in long-term travelers is a complex issue and requires expert advice from travel medicine specialists. <s14> recommendations for prevention of malaria in long-term travelers must be individualized. 
lp+ss: A 100g dose of chloroquine chemoprophylactic regimen results in retinal toxicity after 1 year of weekly intake. <s0> the adult drosophila hindgut was recently reported to contain active, tissue-replenishing stem cells, like those of the midgut, but located within an anterior ring so as to comprise a single giant crypt. <s1> in contrast to this view, we observed no active stem cells and little cell turnover in adult hindgut tissue based on clonal marking and brdu incorporation studies. <s2> again contradicting the previous proposal, we showed that the adult hindgut is not generated by anterior stem cells during larval/pupal development. <s3> however, severe tissue damage within the hindgut elicits cell proliferation within a ring of putative quiescent stem cells at the anterior of the pylorus. <s4> thus, the hindgut does not provide a model of tissue maintenance by constitutively active stem cells, but has great potential to illuminate mechanisms of stress-induced tissue repair.

lp+ss: A T helper 2 cell (Th2) environment impedes disease development in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). <s0> recently, single-molecule imaging and photocontrol have enabled superresolution optical microscopy of cellular structures beyond abbe's diffraction limit, extending the frontier of noninvasive imaging of structures within living cells. <s1> however, live-cell superresolution imaging has been challenged by the need to image three-dimensional (3d) structures relative to their biological context, such as the cellular membrane. <s2> we have developed a technique, termed superresolution by power-dependent active intermittency and points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (spraipaint) that combines imaging of intracellular enhanced yfp (eyfp) fusions (sprai) with stochastic localization of the cell surface (paint) to image two different fluorophores sequentially with only one laser. <s3> simple light-induced blinking of eyfp and collisional flux onto the cell surface by nile red are used to achieve single-molecule localizations, without any antibody labeling, cell membrane permeabilization, or thiol-oxygen scavenger systems required. <s4> here we demonstrate live-cell 3d superresolution imaging of crescentin-eyfp, a cytoskeletal fluorescent protein fusion, colocalized with the surface of the bacterium caulobacter crescentus using a double-helix point spread function microscope. <s5> three-dimensional colocalization of intracellular protein structures and the cell surface with superresolution optical microscopy opens the door for the analysis of protein interactions in living cells with excellent precision (20-40 nm in 3d) over a large field of view (12 12 μm). 
lp+ss: A breast cancer patient's capacity to metabolize tamoxifen influences treatment outcome. <s0> context the growth inhibitory effect of tamoxifen, which is used for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, is mediated by its metabolites, 4-hydroxytamoxifen and endoxifen. <s1> the formation of active metabolites is catalyzed by the polymorphic cytochrome p450 2d6 (cyp2d6) enzyme.  <s2> objective to determine whether cyp2d6 variation is associated with clinical outcomes in women receiving adjuvant tamoxifen.  <s3> design, setting, and patients retrospective analysis of german and us cohorts of patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen for early stage breast cancer. <s4> the 1325 patients had diagnoses between 1986 and 2005 of stage i through iii breast cancer and were mainly postmenopausal (95.4%). <s5> last follow-up was in december 2008; inclusion criteria were hormone receptor positivity, no metastatic disease at diagnosis, adjuvant tamoxifen therapy, and no chemotherapy. <s6> dna from tumor tissue or blood was genotyped for cyp2d6 variants associated with reduced (*10, *41) or absent (*3, *4, *5) enzyme activity. <s7> women were classified as having an extensive (n=609), heterozygous extensive/intermediate (n=637), or poor (n=79) cyp2d6 metabolism.  <s8> main outcome measures time to recurrence, event-free survival, disease-free survival, and overall survival.  <s9> results median follow-up was 6.3 years. <s10> at 9 years of follow-up, the recurrence rates were 14.9% for extensive metabolizers, 20.9% for heterozygous extensive/intermediate metabolizers, and 29.0% for poor metabolizers, and all-cause mortality rates were 16.7%, 18.0%, and 22.8%, respectively. <s11> compared with extensive metabolizers, there was a significantly increased risk of recurrence for heterozygous extensive/intermediate metabolizers (time to recurrence adjusted hazard ratio [hr], 1.40; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.04-1.90) and for poor metabolizers (time to recurrence hr, 1.90; 95% ci, 1.10-3.28). <s12> compared with extensive metabolizers, those with decreased cyp2d6 activity (heterozygous extensive/intermediate and poor metabolism) had worse event-free survival (hr, 1.33; 95% ci, 1.06-1.68) and disease-free survival (hr, 1.29; 95% ci, 1.03-1.61), but there was no significant difference in overall survival (hr, 1.15; 95% ci, 0.88-1.51).  <s13> conclusion among women with breast cancer treated with tamoxifen, there was an association between cyp2d6 variation and clinical outcomes, such that the presence of 2 functional cyp2d6 alleles was associated with better clinical outcomes and the presence of nonfunctional or reduced-function alleles with worse outcomes.

lp+ss: A country's Vaccine Alliance (GAVI) eligibility is not indictivate of accelerated adoption of the Hub vaccine. <s0> we have demonstrated previously that a combination of signals from the neural tube and the floor plate/notochord complex synergistically induce the expression of myogenic bhlh genes and myogenic differentiation markers in unspecified somites. <s1> in this study we demonstrate that sonic hedgehog (shh), which is expressed in the floor plate/notochord, and a subset of wnt family members (wnt-1, wnt-3, and wnt-4), which are expressed in dorsal regions of the neural tube, mimic the muscle inducing activity of these tissues. <s2> in combination, shh and either wnt-1 or wnt-3 are sufficient to induce myogenesis in somitic tissue in vitro. <s3> therefore, we propose that myotome formation in vivo may be directed by the combinatorial activity of shh secreted by ventral midline tissues (floor plate and notochord) and wnt ligands secreted by the dorsal neural tube.

lp+ss: A deficiency of vitamin B6 decreases blood levels of homocysteine. <s0> autophagy is a process in which subcellular membranes undergo dynamic morphological changes that lead to the degradation of cellular proteins and cytoplasmic organelles. <s1> this process is an important cellular response to stress or starvation. <s2> many studies have shed light on the importance of autophagy in cancer, but it is still unclear whether autophagy suppresses tumorigenesis or provides cancer cells with a rescue mechanism under unfavourable conditions. <s3> what is the present state of our knowledge about the role of autophagy in cancer development, and in response to therapy? <s4> and how can the autophagic process be manipulated to improve anticancer therapeutics? 
lp+ss: A deficiency of vitamin B6 decreases blood levels of homocysteine. <s0> cd4+cd25+ regulatory t cells (treg's) play a pivotal role in preventing organ-specific autoimmune diseases and in inducing tolerance to allogeneic organ transplants. <s1> we and others recently demonstrated that high numbers of treg's can also modulate graft-versus-host disease (gvhd) if administered in conjunction with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in mice. <s2> in a clinical setting, it would be impossible to obtain enough freshly purified treg's from a single donor to have a therapeutic effect. <s3> thus, we performed regulatory t cell expansion ex vivo by stimulation with allogeneic apcs, which has the additional effect of producing alloantigen-specific regulatory t cells. <s4> here we show that regulatory t cells specific for recipient-type alloantigens control gvhd while favoring immune reconstitution. <s5> irrelevant regulatory t cells only mediate a partial protection from gvhd. <s6> preferential survival of specific regulatory t cells, but not of irrelevant regulatory t cells, was observed in grafted animals. <s7> additionally, the use of specific regulatory t cells was compatible with some form of graft-versus-tumor activity. <s8> these data suggest that recipient-type specific treg's could be preferentially used in the control of gvhd in future clinical trials.

lp+ss: A high microerythrocyte count protects against severe anemia in homozygous alpha (+)- thalassemia trait subjects. <s0> energy deficiency and dysfunction of the na+, k+-atpase are common consequences of many pathological insults. <s1> the nature and mechanism of cell injury induced by impaired na+, k+-atpase, however, are not well defined. <s2> we used cultured cortical neurons to examine the hypothesis that blocking the na+, k+-atpase induces apoptosis by depleting cellular k+ and, concurrently, induces necrotic injury in the same cells by increasing intracellular ca2+ and na+. <s3> the na+, k+-atpase inhibitor ouabain induced concentration-dependent neuronal death. <s4> ouabain triggered transient neuronal cell swelling followed by cell shrinkage, accompanied by intracellular ca2+ and na+ increase, k+ decrease, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation, and dna laddering. <s5> electron microscopy revealed the coexistence of ultrastructural features of both apoptosis and necrosis in individual cells. <s6> the caspase inhibitor z-val-ala-asp(ome)-fluoromethyl ketone (z-vad-fmk) blocked >50% of ouabain-induced neuronal death. <s7> potassium channel blockers or high k+ medium, but not ca2+ channel blockade, prevented cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and dna damage. <s8> blocking of k+, ca2+, or na+ channels or high k+ medium each attenuated the ouabain-induced cell death; combined inhibition of k+ channels and ca2+ or na+ channels resulted in additional protection. <s9> moreover, coapplication of z-vad-fmk and nifedipine produced virtually complete neuroprotection. <s10> these results suggest that the neuronal death associated with na+, k+-pump failure consists of concurrent apoptotic and necrotic components, mediated by intracellular depletion of k+ and accumulation of ca2+ and na+, respectively. <s11> the ouabain-induced hybrid death may represent a distinct form of cell death related to the brain injury of inadequate energy supply and disrupted ion homeostasis. 
lp+ss: A low percentage of hematopoietic progenitor cells are susceptible to HIV-1 infection ex vivo. <s0> hiv causes a chronic infection characterized by depletion of cd4(+) t lymphocytes and the development of opportunistic infections. <s1> despite drugs that inhibit viral spread, hiv infection has been difficult to cure because of uncharacterized reservoirs of infected cells that are resistant to highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart) and the immune response. <s2> here we used cd34(+) cells from infected people as well as in vitro studies of wild-type hiv to show infection and killing of cd34(+) multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells (hpcs). <s3> in some hpcs, we detected latent infection that stably persisted in cell culture until viral gene expression was activated by differentiation factors. <s4> a unique reporter hiv that directly detects latently infected cells in vitro confirmed the presence of distinct populations of active and latently infected hpcs. <s5> these findings have major implications for understanding hiv bone marrow pathology and the mechanisms by which hiv causes persistent infection.

lp+ss: A single nucleotide variant the gene DGKK is strongly associated with increased risk of hypospadias. <s0> hypospadias is a common congenital malformation of the male external genitalia. <s1> we performed a genome-wide association study using pooled dna from 436 individuals with hypospadias (cases) and 494 controls of european descent and selected the highest ranked snps for individual genotyping in the discovery sample, an additional dutch sample of 133 cases and their parents, and a swedish series of 266 cases and 402 controls. <s2> individual genotyping of two snps (rs1934179 and rs7063116) in dgkk, encoding diacylglycerol kinase κ, produced compelling evidence for association with hypospadias in the discovery sample (allele-specific odds ratio (or) = 2.5, p = 2.5 × 10−11 and or = 2.3, p = 2.9 × 10−9, respectively) and in the dutch (or = 3.9, p = 2.4 × 10−5 and or = 3.8, p = 3.4 × 10−5) and swedish (or = 2.5, p = 2.6 × 10−8 and or = 2.2, p = 2.7 × 10−6) replication samples. <s3> expression studies showed expression of dgkk in preputial tissue of cases and controls, which was lower in carriers of the risk allele of rs1934179 (p = 0.047). <s4> we propose dgkk as a major risk gene for hypospadias.

lp+ss: A single nucleotide variant the gene DGKK is strongly associated with increased risk of hypospadias. <s0> chromosomal abnormalities in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll) are detected in up to 80% of patients. <s1> among them, deletions of 11q, 13q, 17p, and trisomy 12 have a known prognostic value and play an important role in cll pathogenesis and evolution, determining patients outcome and therapeutic strategies. <s2> standard methods used to identify these genomic aberrations include both conventional g-banding cytogenetics (cgc) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish). <s3> although fish analyses have been implemented as the gold standard, cgc allows the identification of chromosomal translocations and complex karyotypes, the latest associated with poor outcome. <s4> genomic arrays have a higher resolution that allows the detection of cryptic abnormalities, although these have not been fully implemented in routine laboratories. <s5> in the last years, next generation sequencing (ngs) methods have identified a wide range of gene mutations (e.g., tp53, notch1, sf3b1, and birc3) which have improved our knowledge about cll development, allowing us to refine both the prognostic subgroups and better therapeutic strategies. <s6> clonal evolution has also recently arisen as a key point in cll, integrating cytogenetic alterations and mutations in a dynamic model that improve our understanding about its clinical course and relapse. 
lp+ss: A strong bias in the phage genome locations where the spacers were derived has been observed in many CRISPR subtypes that confer the immunity to phage. <s0> clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr)-cas systems provide adaptive immunity against phage via spacer-encoded crispr rnas that are complementary to invasive nucleic acids. <s1> here, we challenge streptococcus thermophilus with a bacteriophage, and used pcr-based metagenomics to monitor phage-derived spacers daily for 15 days in two experiments. <s2> spacers that target the host chromosome are infrequent and strongly selected against, suggesting autoimmunity is lethal. <s3> in experiments that recover over half a million spacers, we observe early dominance by a few spacer sub-populations and rapid oscillations in sub-population abundances. <s4> in two crispr systems and in replicate experiments, a few spacers account for the majority of spacer sequences. <s5> nearly all phage locations targeted by the acquired spacers have a proto-spacer adjacent motif (pam), indicating pams are involved in spacer acquisition. <s6> we detect a strong and reproducible bias in the phage genome locations from which spacers derive. <s7> this may reflect selection for specific spacers based on location and effectiveness.

lp+ss: A strong bias in the phage genome locations where the spacers were derived has been observed in many CRISPR subtypes that confer the immunity to phage. <s0> the histone h3 lys 9 (h3k9) methyltransferase eset is an epigenetic regulator critical for the development of the inner cell mass (icm). <s1> although icm-derived embryonic stem (es) cells are normally unable to contribute to the trophectoderm (te) in blastocysts, we find that depletion of eset by shrnas leads to differentiation with the formation of trophoblast-like cells and induction of trophoblast-associated gene expression. <s2> using chromatin immmunoprecipitation (chip) and sequencing (chip-seq) analyses, we identified eset target genes with eset-dependent h3k9 trimethylation. <s3> we confirmed that genes that are preferentially expressed in the te (tcfap2a and cdx2) are bound and repressed by eset. <s4> single-cell pcr analysis shows that the expression of cdx2 and tcfap2a is also induced in eset-depleted morula cells. <s5> importantly, eset-depleted cells can incorporate into the te of a blastocyst and, subsequently, placental tissues. <s6> coimmunoprecipitation and chip assays further demonstrate that eset interacts with oct4, which in turn recruits eset to silence these trophoblast-associated genes. <s7> our results suggest that eset restricts the extraembryonic trophoblast lineage potential of pluripotent cells and links an epigenetic regulator to key cell fate decision through a pluripotency factor. 
lp+ss: A strong bias in the phage genome locations where the spacers were derived has been observed in many CRISPR subtypes that confer the immunity to phage. <s0> fibroblasts often constitute the majority of the stromal cells within a breast carcinoma, yet the functional contributions of these cells to tumorigenesis are poorly understood. <s1> using a coimplantation tumor xenograft model, we demonstrate that carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (cafs) extracted from human breast carcinomas promote the growth of admixed breast carcinoma cells significantly more than do normal mammary fibroblasts derived from the same patients. <s2> the cafs, which exhibit the traits of myofibroblasts, play a central role in promoting the growth of tumor cells through their ability to secrete stromal cell-derived factor 1 (sdf-1); cafs promote angiogenesis by recruiting endothelial progenitor cells (epcs) into carcinomas, an effect mediated in part by sdf-1. <s3> caf-secreted sdf-1 also stimulates tumor growth directly, acting through the cognate receptor, cxcr4, which is expressed by carcinoma cells. <s4> our findings indicate that fibroblasts within invasive breast carcinomas contribute to tumor promotion in large part through the secretion of sdf-1. 
lp+ss: ALDH1 expression is associated with poorer prognosis for breast cancer primary tumors. <s0> application of stem cell biology to breast cancer research has been limited by the lack of simple methods for identification and isolation of normal and malignant stem cells. <s1> utilizing in vitro and in vivo experimental systems, we show that normal and cancer human mammary epithelial cells with increased aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (aldh) have stem/progenitor properties. <s2> these cells contain the subpopulation of normal breast epithelium with the broadest lineage differentiation potential and greatest growth capacity in a xenotransplant model. <s3> in breast carcinomas, high aldh activity identifies the tumorigenic cell fraction, capable of self-renewal and of generating tumors that recapitulate the heterogeneity of the parental tumor. <s4> in a series of 577 breast carcinomas, expression of aldh1 detected by immunostaining correlated with poor prognosis. <s5> these findings offer an important new tool for the study of normal and malignant breast stem cells and facilitate the clinical application of stem cell concepts.

lp+ss: AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation reduces inflammation-related fibrosis in the lungs. <s0> fibrosis is a pathological result of a dysfunctional repair response to tissue injury and occurs in a number of organs, including the lungs1. <s1> cellular metabolism regulates tissue repair and remodelling responses to injury2-4. <s2> ampk is a critical sensor of cellular bioenergetics and controls the switch from anabolic to catabolic metabolism5. <s3> however, the role of ampk in fibrosis is not well understood. <s4> here, we demonstrate that in humans with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) and in an experimental mouse model of lung fibrosis, ampk activity is lower in fibrotic regions associated with metabolically active and apoptosis-resistant myofibroblasts. <s5> pharmacological activation of ampk in myofibroblasts from lungs of humans with ipf display lower fibrotic activity, along with enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and normalization of sensitivity to apoptosis. <s6> in a bleomycin model of lung fibrosis in mice, metformin therapeutically accelerates the resolution of well-established fibrosis in an ampk-dependent manner. <s7> these studies implicate deficient ampk activation in non-resolving, pathologic fibrotic processes, and support a role for metformin (or other ampk activators) to reverse established fibrosis by facilitating deactivation and apoptosis of myofibroblasts.

lp+ss: ART substantially reduces infectiveness of HIV-positive people. <s0> standardization of immunophenotyping procedures has become a high priority. <s1> we have developed a suite of whole-blood, syringe-based assay systems that can be used to reproducibly assess induced innate or adaptive immune responses. <s2> by eliminating preanalytical errors associated with immune monitoring, we have defined the protein signatures induced by (1) medically relevant bacteria, fungi, and viruses; (2) agonists specific for defined host sensors; (3) clinically employed cytokines; and (4) activators of t cell immunity. <s3> our results provide an initial assessment of healthy donor reference values for induced cytokines and chemokines and we report the failure to release interleukin-1α as a common immunological phenotype. <s4> the observed naturally occurring variation of the immune response may help to explain differential susceptibility to disease or response to therapeutic intervention. <s5> the implementation of a general solution for assessment of functional immune responses will help support harmonization of clinical studies and data sharing. 
lp+ss: ATF4 is a general endoplasmic reticulum stress marker. <s0> endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress causes pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and contributes to β-cell loss and the progression of type 2 diabetes. <s1> wolfram syndrome 1 (wfs1) has been shown to be an important regulator of the er stress signalling pathway; however, its role in β-cell function remains unclear. <s2> here we provide evidence that wfs1 is essential for glucose- and glucagon-like peptide 1 (glp-1)-stimulated cyclic amp production and regulation of insulin biosynthesis and secretion. <s3> stimulation with glucose causes wfs1 translocation from the er to the plasma membrane, where it forms a complex with adenylyl cyclase 8 (ac8), an essential camp-generating enzyme in the β-cell that integrates glucose and glp-1 signalling. <s4> er stress and mutant wfs1 inhibit complex formation and activation of ac8, reducing camp synthesis and insulin secretion. <s5> these findings reveal that an er-stress-related protein has a distinct role outside the er regulating both insulin biosynthesis and secretion. <s6> the reduction of wfs1 protein on the plasma membrane during er stress is a contributing factor for β-cell dysfunction and progression of type 2 diabetes. 
lp+ss: ATF4 is a general endoplasmic reticulum stress marker. <s0> clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr)-cas systems provide adaptive immunity against phage via spacer-encoded crispr rnas that are complementary to invasive nucleic acids. <s1> here, we challenge streptococcus thermophilus with a bacteriophage, and used pcr-based metagenomics to monitor phage-derived spacers daily for 15 days in two experiments. <s2> spacers that target the host chromosome are infrequent and strongly selected against, suggesting autoimmunity is lethal. <s3> in experiments that recover over half a million spacers, we observe early dominance by a few spacer sub-populations and rapid oscillations in sub-population abundances. <s4> in two crispr systems and in replicate experiments, a few spacers account for the majority of spacer sequences. <s5> nearly all phage locations targeted by the acquired spacers have a proto-spacer adjacent motif (pam), indicating pams are involved in spacer acquisition. <s6> we detect a strong and reproducible bias in the phage genome locations from which spacers derive. <s7> this may reflect selection for specific spacers based on location and effectiveness. 
lp+ss: ATM and Rad3 related protein are critical for sensing DNA damage. <s0> methylphenidate is a medication used routinely in the management of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. <s1> we report a case of a prepubertal child who developed unwanted erections after commencing a response-adjusted dosing regimen of sustained release methylphenidate. <s2> despite priapism being a rare adverse reaction associated with methylphenidate, physicians and parents need to be aware as it can have significant long-term complications. 
lp+ss: ATM and Rad3 related protein have no role in sensing DNA damage. <s0> neutrophils are peripheral blood leukocytes that represent the first line of immune cell defense against bacterial and fungal infections but are also crucial players in the generation of the inflammatory response. <s1> many neutrophil cell surface receptors regulate important cellular processes via activation of agonist-activated pi3ks. <s2> we show here that activation of human neutrophils with insoluble immune complexes drives a previously uncharacterized, pi3k-dependent, non-canonical, pro-apoptotic signaling pathway, fcγr-pi3kβ/δ-cdc42-pak-mek-erk. <s3> this is a rare demonstration of ras/raf-independent activation of erk and of pi3k-mediated activation of cdc42. <s4> in addition, comparative analysis of immune-complex- and fmlf-induced signaling uncovers key differences in pathways used by human and murine neutrophils. <s5> the non-canonical pathway we identify in this study may be important for the resolution of inflammation in chronic inflammatory diseases that rely on immune-complex-driven neutrophil activation. 
lp+ss: AZT given with ribavirin increases anemia. <s0> background the aim of this study was to examine the clustering of four major lifestyle risk factors (smoking, heavy drinking, lack of fruit and vegetables consumption, and lack of physical activity), and to examine the variation across different socio-demographic groups in the english adult population.  <s1> methods the study population was derived from the 2003 health survey for england (n=11,492). <s2> clustering was examined by comparing the observed and expected prevalence of the different possible combinations. <s3> a multinomial multilevel regression model was conducted to examine the socio-demographic variation in the clustering of the four risk factors.  <s4> results the study found that, when using british health recommendations, a majority of the english population have multiple lifestyle risk factors at the same time. <s5> clustering was found at both ends of the lifestyle spectrum and was more pronounced for women than for men. <s6> overall, multiple risk factors were more prevalent among men, lower social class households, singles, and people who are economically inactive, but less prevalent among home owners and older age groups.  <s7> conclusions the clustering of multiple risk factors provides support for multiple-behavior interventions as opposed to single-behavior interventions. 
lp+ss: AZT given with ribavirin increases anemia. <s0> microbial survival in a host is usually dependent on the ability of a pathogen to undergo changes that promote escape from host defense mechanisms. <s1> the human-pathogenic fungus cryptococcus neoformans undergoes phenotypic switching in vivo that promotes persistence in tissue. <s2> by microarray and real-time pcr analyses, the allergen 1 gene (all1) was found to be downregulated in the hypervirulent mucoid switch variant, both during logarithmic growth and during intracellular growth in macrophages. <s3> the all1 gene encodes a small cytoplasmic protein that is involved in capsule formation. <s4> growth of an all1delta gene deletion mutant was normal. <s5> similar to cells of the mucoid switch variant, all1delta cells produced a larger polysaccharide capsule than cells of the smooth parent and the complemented strain produced, and the enlarged capsule inhibited macrophage phagocytosis. <s6> the mutant exhibited a modest defect in capsule induction compared to all of the other variants. <s7> in animal models the phenotype of the all1delta mutant mimicked the hypervirulent phenotype of the mucoid switch variant, which is characterized by decreased host survival and elevated intracranial pressure. <s8> decreased survival is likely the result of both an ineffective cell-mediated immune response and impaired phagocytosis by macrophages. <s9> consequently, we concluded that, unlike loss of most virulence-associated genes, where loss of gene function results in attenuated virulence, loss of the all1 gene enhances virulence by altering the host-pathogen interaction and thereby impairing clearance. <s10> our data identified the first cryptococcal gene associated with elevated intracranial pressure and support the hypothesis that an environmental opportunistic pathogen has modified its virulence in vivo by epigenetic downregulation of gene function. 
lp+ss: Activated Cdk5 phosphorylates the ATM protein in response to DNA damage. <s0> the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-like kinase atm (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) has a central role in coordinating dna damage responses, including cell-cycle checkpoint control, dna repair and apoptosis. <s1> mutations of atm cause a spectrum of defects ranging from neurodegeneration to cancer predisposition. <s2> however, the mechanism by which dna damage activates atm is poorly understood. <s3> here we show that cdk5 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5), activated by dna damage, directly phosphorylates atm at ser 794 in post-mitotic neurons. <s4> phosphorylation at ser 794 precedes, and is required for, atm autophosphorylation at ser 1981, and activates atm kinase activity. <s5> the cdk5-atm signal regulates phosphorylation and function of the atm targets p53 and h2ax. <s6> interruption of the cdk5-atm pathway attenuates dna-damage-induced neuronal cell cycle re-entry and expression of the p53 targets puma and bax, protecting neurons from death. <s7> thus, activation of cdk5 by dna damage serves as a critical signal to initiate the atm response and regulate atm-dependent cellular processes.

lp+ss: Activated Cdk5 phosphorylates the ATM protein in response to DNA damage. <s0> the histone variant h2az is incorporated preferentially at specific locations in chromatin to modulate chromosome functions. <s1> in saccharomyces cerevisiae, deposition of histone h2az is mediated by the multiprotein swr1 complex, which catalyzes atp-dependent exchange of nucleosomal histone h2a for h2az. <s2> here, we define interactions between swr1 components and h2az, revealing a link between the atpase domain of swr1 and three subunits required for the binding of h2az. <s3> we discovered that swc2 binds directly to and is essential for transfer of h2az. <s4> swc6 and arp6 are necessary for the association of swc2 and for nucleosome binding, whereas other subunits, swc5 and yaf9, are required for h2az transfer but neither h2az nor nucleosome binding. <s5> finally, the c-terminal α-helix of h2az is crucial for its recognition by swr1. <s6> these findings provide insight on the initial events of histone exchange. 
lp+ss: Activated Cdk5 phosphorylates the ATM protein in response to DNA damage. <s0> numerous reports have demonstrated that cd4(+)cd25(+) regulatory t cells (tregs) from individuals with a range of human autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes, are deficient in their ability to control autologous proinflammatory responses when compared with nondiseased, control individuals. <s1> treg dysfunction could be a primary, causal event or may result from perturbations in the immune system during disease development. <s2> polymorphisms in genes associated with treg function, such as il2ra, confer a higher risk of autoimmune disease. <s3> although this suggests a primary role for defective tregs in autoimmunity, a link between il2ra gene polymorphisms and treg function has not been examined. <s4> we addressed this by examining the impact of an il2ra haplotype associated with type 1 diabetes on treg fitness and suppressive function. <s5> studies were conducted using healthy human subjects to avoid any confounding effects of disease. <s6> we demonstrated that the presence of an autoimmune disease-associated il2ra haplotype correlates with diminished il-2 responsiveness in ag-experienced cd4(+) t cells, as measured by phosphorylation of stat5a, and is associated with lower levels of foxp3 expression by tregs and a reduction in their ability to suppress proliferation of autologous effector t cells. <s7> these data offer a rationale that contributes to the molecular and cellular mechanisms through which polymorphisms in the il-2ra gene affect immune regulation, and consequently upon susceptibility to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

lp+ss: Activated Cdk5 regulates DNA damage-induced neuronal death. <s0> objective the aim was to describe the sex and socioeconomic differences in patterns of physical activity at work and in leisure time of men and women aged 36 years, and to investigate factors in childhood and adolescence which predict high rates of participation in sports and recreational activities in later life.  <s1> design data collected in childhood, adolescence, and at 36 years on members of a national prospective birth cohort study were used.  <s2> setting <s3> the population sample was resident in england, scotland, and wales.    <s4> subjects a stratified sample of about 3500 men and women was studied regularly from birth until 43 years.  <s5> measurements and main results more men than women reported high rates of sports and recreational activities, gardening, and do-it-yourself. <s6> in contrast women reported higher rates of bicycling and walking. <s7> higher levels of education were associated with frequent participation in sports. <s8> individuals often engaged in one type of activity without necessarily engaging in other types. <s9> those who were most active in sport had been above average at sports in school, more outgoing socially in adolescence, had fewer health problems in childhood, were better educated, and had more mothers with a secondary education than those who were less active.  <s10> conclusions studies that examine the relationship between physical activity and chronic disease should consider a broad range of pursuits rather than extrapolating from only one area of physical activity, and in their explanations should take account of the possible role of childhood characteristics. <s11> the findings suggest the importance of developing skills and habits in childhood as well as of encouraging healthier exercise habits in adults who may have had few opportunities or low motivation previously. 
lp+ss: Activated Cdk5 regulates DNA damage-induced neuronal death. <s0> new blood vessel formation (angiogenesis) is a fundamental event in the process of tumor growth and metastatic dissemination. <s1> hence, the molecular basis of tumor angiogenesis has been of keen interest in the field of cancer research. <s2> the vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) pathway is well established as one of the key regulators of this process. <s3> the vegf/vegf-receptor axis is composed of multiple ligands and receptors with overlapping and distinct ligand-receptor binding specificities, cell-type expression, and function. <s4> activation of the vegf-receptor pathway triggers a network of signaling processes that promote endothelial cell growth, migration, and survival from pre-existing vasculature. <s5> in addition, vegf mediates vessel permeability, and has been associated with malignant effusions. <s6> more recently, an important role for vegf has emerged in mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells from the bone marrow to distant sites of neovascularization. <s7> the well-established role of vegf in promoting tumor angiogenesis and the pathogenesis of human cancers has led to the rational design and development of agents that selectively target this pathway. <s8> studies with various anti-vegf/vegf-receptor therapies have shown that these agents can potently inhibit angiogenesis and tumor growth in preclinical models. <s9> recently, an anti-vegf antibody (bevacizumab), when used in combination with chemotherapy, was shown to significantly improve survival and response rates in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and thus, validate vegf pathway inhibitors as an important new treatment modality in cancer therapy.

lp+ss: Activation of PPM1D enhances p53 function. <s0> improved sequencing technologies offer unprecedented opportunities for investigating the role of rare genetic variation in common disease. <s1> however, there are considerable challenges with respect to study design, data analysis and replication. <s2> using pooled next-generation sequencing of 507 genes implicated in the repair of dna in 1,150 samples, an analytical strategy focused on protein-truncating variants (ptvs) and a large-scale sequencing case–control replication experiment in 13,642 individuals, here we show that rare ptvs in the p53-inducible protein phosphatase ppm1d are associated with predisposition to breast cancer and ovarian cancer. <s3> ppm1d ptv mutations were present in 25 out of 7,781 cases versus 1 out of 5,861 controls (p = 1.12 × 10−5), including 18 mutations in 6,912 individuals with breast cancer (p = 2.42 × 10−4) and 12 mutations in 1,121 individuals with ovarian cancer (p = 3.10 × 10−9). <s4> notably, all of the identified ppm1d ptvs were mosaic in lymphocyte dna and clustered within a 370-base-pair region in the final exon of the gene, carboxy-terminal to the phosphatase catalytic domain. <s5> functional studies demonstrate that the mutations result in enhanced suppression of p53 in response to ionizing radiation exposure, suggesting that the mutant alleles encode hyperactive ppm1d isoforms. <s6> thus, although the mutations cause premature protein truncation, they do not result in the simple loss-of-function effect typically associated with this class of variant, but instead probably have a gain-of-function effect. <s7> our results have implications for the detection and management of breast and ovarian cancer risk. <s8> more generally, these data provide new insights into the role of rare and of mosaic genetic variants in common conditions, and the use of sequencing in their identification.

lp+ss: Activation of the Rac1 homolog CED-10 kills viable cells in SRGP-1 mutant Caenorhabditis elegans. <s0> multicellular animals rapidly clear dying cells from their bodies. <s1> many of the pathways that mediate this cell removal are conserved through evolution. <s2> here, we identify srgp-1 as a negative regulator of cell clearance in both caenorhabditis elegans and mammalian cells. <s3> loss of srgp-1 function results in improved engulfment of apoptotic cells, whereas srgp-1 overexpression inhibits apoptotic cell corpse removal. <s4> we show that srgp-1 functions in engulfing cells and functions as a gtpase activating protein (gap) for ced-10 (rac1). <s5> interestingly, loss of srgp-1 function promotes not only the clearance of already dead cells, but also the removal of cells that have been brought to the verge of death through sublethal apoptotic, necrotic or cytotoxic insults. <s6> in contrast, impaired engulfment allows damaged cells to escape clearance, which results in increased long-term survival. <s7> we propose that c. elegans uses the engulfment machinery as part of a primitive, but evolutionarily conserved, survey mechanism that identifies and removes unfit cells within a tissue.

lp+ss: Activator-inhibitor pairs are provided ventrally by Xrl-sizzled. <s0> embryos have the ability to self-regulate and regenerate normal structures after being sectioned in half. <s1> how is such a morphogenetic field established? <s2> we discovered that quadruple knockdown of admp and bmp2/4/7 in xenopus embryos eliminates self-regulation, causing ubiquitous neural induction throughout the ectoderm. <s3> admp transcription in the spemann organizer is activated at low bmp levels. <s4> when ventral bmp2/4/7 signals are depleted, admp expression increases, allowing for self-regulation. <s5> admp has bmp-like activity and signals via the alk-2 receptor. <s6> it is unable to signal dorsally because of inhibition by chordin. <s7> the ventral bmp antagonists sizzled and bambi further refine the pattern. <s8> by transplanting dorsal or ventral wild-type grafts into admp/bmp2/4/7-depleted hosts, we demonstrate that both poles serve as signaling centers that can induce histotypic differentiation over considerable distances. <s9> we conclude that dorsal and ventral bmp signals and their extracellular antagonists expressed under opposing transcriptional regulation provide a molecular mechanism for embryonic self-regulation. 
lp+ss: Active H. pylori urease has a polymeric structure consisting of five distinct subunits. <s0> there is persuasive clinical and experimental evidence that macrophages promote cancer initiation and malignant progression. <s1> during tumor initiation, they create an inflammatory environment that is mutagenic and promotes growth. <s2> as tumors progress to malignancy, macrophages stimulate angiogenesis, enhance tumor cell migration and invasion, and suppress antitumor immunity. <s3> at metastatic sites, macrophages prepare the target tissue for arrival of tumor cells, and then a different subpopulation of macrophages promotes tumor cell extravasation, survival, and subsequent growth. <s4> specialized subpopulations of macrophages may represent important new therapeutic targets. 
lp+ss: Active H. pylori urease has a polymeric structure consisting of five distinct subunits. <s0> the persistence of transcriptionally silent but replication-competent hiv-1 reservoirs in highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart)-treated infected individuals, represents a major hurdle to virus eradication. <s1> activation of hiv-1 gene expression in these cells together with an efficient haart has been proposed as an adjuvant therapy aimed at decreasing the pool of latent viral reservoirs. <s2> using the latently-infected u1 monocytic cell line and latently-infected j-lat t-cell clones, we here demonstrated a strong synergistic activation of hiv-1 production by clinically used histone deacetylase inhibitors (hdacis) combined with prostratin, a non-tumor-promoting nuclear factor (nf)- kappab inducer. <s3> in j-lat cells, we showed that this synergism was due, at least partially, to the synergistic recruitment of unresponsive cells into the expressing cell population. <s4> a combination of prostratin+hdaci synergistically activated the 5' long terminal repeat (5'ltr) from hiv-1 major group subtypes representing the most prevalent viral genetic forms, as shown by transient transfection reporter assays. <s5> mechanistically, hdacis increased prostratin-induced dna-binding activity of nuclear nf-kappab and degradation of cytoplasmic nf-kappab inhibitor, ikappabalpha . <s6> moreover, the combined treatment prostratin+hdaci caused a more pronounced nucleosomal remodeling in the u1 viral promoter region than the treatments with the compounds alone. <s7> this more pronounced remodeling correlated with a synergistic reactivation of hiv-1 transcription following the combined treatment prostratin+hdaci, as demonstrated by measuring recruitment of rna polymerase ii to the 5'ltr and both initiated and elongated transcripts. <s8> the physiological relevance of the prostratin+hdaci synergism was shown in cd8(+)-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells from haart-treated patients with undetectable viral load. <s9> moreover, this combined treatment reactivated viral replication in resting cd4(+) t cells isolated from similar patients. <s10> our results suggest that combinations of different kinds of proviral activators may have important implications for reducing the size of latent hiv-1 reservoirs in haart-treated patients. 
lp+ss: Active Ly49Q induces neutrophil polarization. <s0> neutrophils rapidly undergo polarization and directional movement to infiltrate the sites of infection and inflammation. <s1> here, we show that an inhibitory mhc i receptor, ly49q, was crucial for the swift polarization of and tissue infiltration by neutrophils. <s2> during the steady state, ly49q inhibited neutrophil adhesion by preventing focal-complex formation, likely by inhibiting src and pi3 kinases. <s3> however, in the presence of inflammatory stimuli, ly49q mediated rapid neutrophil polarization and tissue infiltration in an itim-domain-dependent manner. <s4> these opposite functions appeared to be mediated by distinct use of effector phosphatase shp-1 and shp-2. <s5> ly49q-dependent polarization and migration were affected by ly49q regulation of membrane raft functions. <s6> we propose that ly49q is pivotal in switching neutrophils to their polarized morphology and rapid migration upon inflammation, through its spatiotemporal regulation of membrane rafts and raft-associated signaling molecules.

lp+ss: Active caspase-11 protein promotes pyroptosis. <s0> responses of cerebral blood vessels to nitric oxide (no) are mediated by soluble guanylate cyclase (sgc)-dependent and potentially by sgc-independent mechanisms. <s1> one sgc-independent mechanism by which no may produce vasodilatation is inhibition of formation of a vasoconstrictor metabolite produced through the cytochrome p450 pathway. <s2> in these experiments, we examined the hypothesis that dilatation of cerebral microvessels in response to no is dependent on activation of sgc. <s3> diameters of cerebral arterioles (baseline diameter=94+/-5 micrometers, mean+/-s.e.) were measured using a closed cranial window in anesthetized rabbits. <s4> under control conditions, yc-1 [3-(5'-hydroxymethyl-2'-furyl)-1-benzyl indazole], an no-independent activator of sgc, produced vasodilation that was blocked by odq (1h-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3,-a]quinoxalin-1-one)(10 microm), an inhibitor of sgc. <s5> these findings indicate that sgc is functionally important in cerebral arterioles. <s6> in addition, acetylcholine (which stimulates endogenous production of no by endothelium) produced dilatation of cerebral arterioles that was inhibited by odq. <s7> for example, 1 microm acetylcholine dilated cerebral arterioles by 34+/-7 and 5+/-1% in the absence and presence of odq (10 microm), respectively. <s8> increases in arteriolar diameter in response to sodium nitroprusside (1 microm, an no donor) were inhibited by approximately 80% by odq, but were not affected by 17-odya (10 microm) or clotrimazole (10 microm), inhibitors of the cytochrome p450 pathway. <s9> thus, dilatation of the cerebral microcirculation in response to exogenously applied and endogenously produced no is dependent, in large part, on activation of sgc. 
lp+ss: Acute ablation of KRAS causes severe growth impairment. <s0> induction of compensatory mechanisms and erk reactivation has limited the effectiveness of raf and mek inhibitors in ras-mutant cancers. <s1> we determined that direct pharmacologic inhibition of erk suppressed the growth of a subset of kras-mutant pancreatic cancer cell lines and that concurrent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k) inhibition caused synergistic cell death. <s2> additional combinations that enhanced erk inhibitor action were also identified. <s3> unexpectedly, long-term treatment of sensitive cell lines caused senescence, mediated in part by myc degradation and p16 reactivation. <s4> enhanced basal pi3k-akt-mtor signaling was associated with de novo resistance to erk inhibitor, as were other protein kinases identified by kinome-wide sirna screening and a genetic gain-of-function screen. <s5> our findings reveal distinct consequences of inhibiting this kinase cascade at the level of erk. 
lp+ss: Acute ablation of KRAS causes severe growth impairment. <s0> all vertebrates, including humans, obtain most of their daily vitamin d requirement from casual exposure to sunlight. <s1> during exposure to sunlight, the solar ultraviolet b photons (290-315 nm) penetrate into the skin where they cause the photolysis of 7-dehydrocholesterol to precholecalciferol. <s2> once formed, precholecalciferol undergoes a thermally induced rearrangement of its double bonds to form cholecalciferol. <s3> an increase in skin pigmentation, aging, and the topical application of a sunscreen diminishes the cutaneous production of cholecalciferol. <s4> latitude, season, and time of day as well as ozone pollution in the atmosphere influence the number of solar ultraviolet b photons that reach the earth's surface, and thereby, alter the cutaneous production of cholecalciferol. <s5> in boston, exposure to sunlight during the months of november through february will not produce any significant amounts of cholecalciferol in the skin. <s6> because windowpane glass absorbs ultraviolet b radiation, exposure of sunlight through glass windows will not result in any production of cholecalciferol. <s7> it is now recognized that vitamin d insufficiency and vitamin d deficiency are common in elderly people, especially in those who are infirm and not exposed to sunlight or who live at latitudes that do not provide them with sunlight-mediated cholecalciferol during the winter months. <s8> vitamin d insufficiency and deficiency exacerbate osteoporosis, cause osteomalacia, and increase the risk of skeletal fractures. <s9> vitamin d insufficiency and deficiency can be prevented by encouraging responsible exposure to sunlight and/or consumption of a multivitamin tablet that contains 10 micrograms (400 iu) vitamin d.

lp+ss: Adult tissue-resident macrophages possess a self-renewing capacity. <s0> background due to demographic changes with an increasing number of older people with chronic illness and multimorbidity palliative care for geriatric patients has become increasingly important. <s1> the aim of this study was to explore the perspective of bereaved relatives with regard to their experiences and expectations concerning the delivery of care for older people in the last phase of life.  <s2> methods qualitative interviews with 12 relatives of deceased older patients (aged 60 years or older). <s3> the interviews were recorded, transcribed, coded and analysed using the approach of qualitative content analysis according to mayring.  <s4> results the bereaved relatives perceived that the care for geriatric patients in the last phase of life was inappropriate in various respects. <s5> they criticised overtreatment (e.g. skin cancer diagnostic) as well as unmet needs (e.g. treatment of pain, patient centred care, communication). <s6> family doctors were seen as the primary contact persons in the professional health system.  <s7> conclusions from the perspective of bereaved relatives care for older people in the last phase of life has serious deficits. <s8> they criticise an inappropriate priority setting and the disregard of palliative care. <s9> there is a need for better communication and information exchange regarding the needs and expectations of patients and relatives, and regarding the targets of treatment. <s10> therefore it may be helpful to use advance directives more intensively. <s11> furthermore, it seems to be necessary to strengthen generalist palliative care particularly delivered by family doctors and community nurses. 
lp+ss: Adult tissue-resident macrophages possess a self-renewing capacity. <s0> the prion protein (prp(c)) is highly expressed in the nervous system and critically involved in prion diseases where it misfolds into pathogenic prp(sc). <s1> moreover, it has been suggested as a receptor mediating neurotoxicity in common neurodegenerative proteinopathies such as alzheimer's disease. <s2> prp(c) is shed at the plasma membrane by the metalloprotease adam10, yet the impact of this on prion disease remains enigmatic. <s3> employing conditional knockout mice, we show that depletion of adam10 in forebrain neurons leads to posttranslational increase of prp(c) levels. <s4> upon prion infection of these mice, clinical, biochemical, and morphological data reveal that lack of adam10 significantly reduces incubation times and increases prp(sc) formation. <s5> in contrast, spatiotemporal analysis indicates that absence of shedding impairs spread of prion pathology. <s6> our data support a dual role for adam10-mediated shedding and highlight the role of proteolytic processing in prion disease.

lp+ss: Adult tissue-resident macrophages stem from the embryonal yolk sac and fetal liver. <s0> elastases of both the neutrophil and macrophage have been implicated in lung disease initiation and progression. <s1> although it is unlikely that these proteases evolved for the purpose of injuring lung tissue, the elastin-rich connective tissue framework of the lungs appears to be particularly susceptible to the action of elastolytic proteases. <s2> assuming that neutrophil elastase most likely plays a role in the migration of neutrophils toward a site of inflammation and degradation of proteins from invading organisms or other products of the inflammatory response, it is the role of inhibitors of this protease to protect normal tissues from its effects. <s3> in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency we find an experiment of nature that disrupts this protease-anti-protease balance, resulting in an increased risk of destructive lung disease. 
lp+ss: Aged patients are less susceptible to ischaemia/reperfusion injury. <s0> chaperone-mediated autophagy (cma), a selective mechanism for degradation of cytosolic proteins in lysosomes, contributes to the removal of altered proteins as part of the cellular quality-control systems. <s1> we have previously found that cma activity declines in aged organisms and have proposed that this failure in cellular clearance could contribute to the accumulation of altered proteins, the abnormal cellular homeostasis and, eventually, the functional loss characteristic of aged organisms. <s2> to determine whether these negative features of aging can be prevented by maintaining efficient autophagic activity until late in life, in this work we have corrected the cma defect in aged rodents. <s3> we have generated a double transgenic mouse model in which the amount of the lysosomal receptor for cma, previously shown to decrease in abundance with age, can be modulated. <s4> we have analyzed in this model the consequences of preventing the age-dependent decrease in receptor abundance in aged rodents at the cellular and organ levels. <s5> we show here that cma activity is maintained until advanced ages if the decrease in the receptor abundance is prevented and that preservation of autophagic activity is associated with lower intracellular accumulation of damaged proteins, better ability to handle protein damage and improved organ function. 
lp+ss: Aggravated inflammation is dependent on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. <s0> development of the acute and chronic inflammatory responses known as gout and pseudogout are associated with the deposition of monosodium urate (msu) or calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (cppd) crystals, respectively, in joints and periarticular tissues. <s1> although msu crystals were first identified as the aetiological agent of gout in the eighteenth century and more recently as a 'danger signal' released from dying cells, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying msu- or cppd-induced inflammation. <s2> here we show that msu and cppd engage the caspase-1-activating nalp3 (also called cryopyrin) inflammasome, resulting in the production of active interleukin (il)-1β and il-18. <s3> macrophages from mice deficient in various components of the inflammasome such as caspase-1, asc and nalp3 are defective in crystal-induced il-1β activation. <s4> moreover, an impaired neutrophil influx is found in an in vivo model of crystal-induced peritonitis in inflammasome-deficient mice or mice deficient in the il-1β receptor (il-1r). <s5> these findings provide insight into the molecular processes underlying the inflammatory conditions of gout and pseudogout, and further support a pivotal role of the inflammasome in several autoinflammatory diseases.

lp+ss: Aggravated inflammation is dependent on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. <s0> background: vasoconstriction and reactive oxygen species (ros) accumulation following contrast media (cm) injection are the key factors triggering cm-induced nephropathy. <s1> we compared the effects of n-acetylcysteine (nac), theophylline or sodium bicarbonate on intrarenal vasoconstriction and ros generation in a rat model of cm-induced nephropathy. <s2> methods: following a 3-day dehydration, sprague-dawley rats received cm (telebrix) or sham 'cm' injection of 0.9% saline. <s3> part of them received nac, theophylline or bicarbonate prior to cm. <s4> medullar renal blood flow was estimated by laser doppler. <s5> the animals were sacrificed 1, 15 or 30 min after the respective treatments, their kidneys allocated and intrarenal stat-8 isoprostane, pge2 and no assessed. <s6> results: vasoconstriction was significantly attenuated by nac. <s7> theophylline only mildly attenuated the perfusion drop at 15 min, and was ineffective following 30 min. <s8> unlike theophylline or bicarbonate, nac significantly augmented intrarenal pge2. <s9> nac, theophylline but not bicarbonate, gradually increased intrarenal no. <s10> in all experimental variables, cm-induced ros accumulation, represented by stat-8 isoprostane estimation, progressed undisturbed. <s11> conclusions: (1) cm-induced intrarenal vasoconstriction was efficiently prohibited by nac but not bicarbonate or theophylline; (2) the vasodilatory effect of nac was mediated via increased pge2 synthesis, and (3) ros accumulation was a primary renal response to cm-induced injury, not affected by any pharmacologic manipulations.

lp+ss: Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are associated with decreased risk for functional renal insufficiency. <s0> background the literature describing the global prevalence of anxiety disorders is highly variable. <s1> a systematic review and meta-regression were undertaken to estimate the prevalence of anxiety disorders and to identify factors that may influence these estimates. <s2> the findings will inform the new global burden of disease study. <s3> method a systematic review identified prevalence studies of anxiety disorders published between 1980 and 2009. <s4> electronic databases, reference lists, review articles and monographs were searched and experts then contacted to identify missing studies. <s5> substantive and methodological factors associated with inter-study variability were identified through meta-regression analyses and the global prevalence of anxiety disorders was calculated adjusting for study methodology.  <s6> results the prevalence of anxiety disorders was obtained from 87 studies across 44 countries. <s7> estimates of current prevalence ranged between 0.9% and 28.3% and past-year prevalence between 2.4% and 29.8%. <s8> substantive factors including gender, age, culture, conflict and economic status, and urbanicity accounted for the greatest proportion of variability. <s9> methodological factors in the final multivariate model (prevalence period, number of disorders and diagnostic instrument) explained an additional 13% of variance between studies. <s10> the global current prevalence of anxiety disorders adjusted for methodological differences was 7.3% (4.8-10.9%) and ranged from 5.3% (3.5-8.1%) in african cultures to 10.4% (7.0-15.5%) in euro/anglo cultures.  <s11> conclusions anxiety disorders are common and the substantive and methodological factors identified here explain much of the variability in prevalence estimates. <s12> specific attention should be paid to cultural differences in responses to survey instruments for anxiety disorders.

lp+ss: Anthrax spores are very difficult to dispose once they are dispersed. <s0> background schisandra, a globally distributed plant, has been widely applied for the treatment of diseases such as hyperlipidemia, fatty liver and obesity in china. <s1> in the present work, a rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with quadruple-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (rrlc-q-tof-ms)-based metabolomics was conducted to investigate the intervention effect of schisandra chinensis lignans (scl) on hyperlipidemia mice induced by high-fat diet (hfd).  <s2> methods hyperlipidemia mice were orally administered with scl (100 mg/kg) once a day for 4 weeks. <s3> serum biochemistry assay of triglyceride (tg), total cholesterol (tc), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdl-c) was conducted to confirm the treatment of scl on lipid regulation. <s4> metabolomics analysis on serum samples was carried out, and principal component analysis (pca) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (pls-da) were carried out for the pattern recognition and characteristic metabolites identification. <s5> the relative levels of critical regulatory factors of liver lipid metabolism, sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (srebps) and its related gene expressions were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) for investigating the underlying mechanism.  <s6> results oral administration of scl significantly decreased the serum levels of tc, tg and ldl-c and increased the serum level of hdl-c in the hyperlipidemia mice, and no effect of scl on blood lipid levels was observed in control mice. <s7> serum samples were scattered in the pca scores plots in response to the control, hfd and scl group. <s8> totally, thirteen biomarkers were identified and nine of them were recovered to the normal levels after scl treatment. <s9> based on the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (kegg) pathways analysis, the anti-hyperlipidemia mechanisms of scl may be involved in the following metabolic pathways: tricarboxylic acid (tca) cycle, synthesis of ketone body and cholesterol, choline metabolism and fatty acid metabolism. <s10> meanwhile, scl significantly inhibited the mrna expression level of hepatic lipogenesis genes such as srebp-1c, fatty acid synthase (fas) and acetyl-coa carboxylase (acc), and decreased the mrna expression of liver x receptor α (lxrα). <s11> moreover, scl also significantly decreased the expression level of srebp-2 and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a reductase (hmgcr) in the liver of hyperlipidemia mice.  <s12> conclusion anti-hyperlipidemia effect of scl was confirmed by both serum biochemistry and metabolomics analysis. <s13> the mechanism may be related to the down-regulation of lxrα/srebp-1c/fas/acc and srebp2/hmgcr signaling pathways. 
lp+ss: Anthrax spores are very difficult to dispose once they are dispersed. <s0> two thousand three hundred and thirty two nonselected brains from 1- to 100-year-old individuals were examined using immunocytochemistry (at8) and gallyas silver staining for abnormal tau; immunocytochemistry (4g8) and campbell-switzer staining were used for the detection ofβ-amyloid. <s1> a total of 342 cases was negative in the gallyas stain but when restaged for at8 only 10 were immunonegative. <s2> fifty-eight cases had subcortical tau predominantly in the locus coeruleus, but there was no abnormal cortical tau (subcortical stages a-c). <s3> cortical involvement (abnormal tau in neurites) was identified first in the transentorhinal region (stage 1a, 38 cases). <s4> transentorhinal pyramidal cells displayed pretangle material (stage 1b, 236 cases). <s5> pretangles gradually became argyrophilic neurofibrillary tangles (nfts) that progressed in parallel with nft stages i to vi. <s6> pretangles restricted to subcortical sites were seen chiefly at younger ages. <s7> of the total cases, 1,031 (44.2%) had β-amyloid plaques. <s8> the first plaques occurred in the neocortex after the onset of tauopathy in the brainstem. <s9> plaques generally developed in the 40s in 4% of all cases, culminating in their tenth decade (75%). <s10> β-amyloid plaques and nfts were significantly correlated (p < 0.0001). <s11> these data suggest that tauopathy associated with sporadic alzheimer disease may begin earlier than previously thought and possibly in the lower brainstem rather than in the transentorhinal region.

lp+ss: Antidepressants reduce the severity of migraines. <s0> using differential interference contrast optics, combined with cinematography, we have studied the morphological changes that the living, syncytial embryo undergoes from stage 10 through 14 of drosophila embryogenesis, that is just prior to and during formation of the cellular blastoderm. <s1> we have supplemented these studies with data collected from fixed, stained, whole embryos. <s2> the following information has been obtained. <s3> the average duration of nuclear cycles 10, 11, 12 and 13 is about 9, 10, 12 and 21 min, respectively (25 degrees c). <s4> in these four cycles, the duration of that portion of the mitotic period that lacks a discrete nuclear envelope is 3, 3, 3 and 5 min, respectively. <s5> the length of nuclear cycle 14 varies in a position-specific manner throughout the embryo, the shortest cycles being of 65 min duration. <s6> during nuclear cycles 10 through 13, it is commonly observed in living embryos that the syncytial blastoderm nuclei enter (and leave) mitosis in one of two waves that originate nearly simultaneously from the opposite anterior and posterior poles of the embryo, and terminate in its midregion. <s7> from our preparations of quick-frozen embryos, we estimate that these mitotic waves take on average about half a minute to travel over the embryonic surface from pole to equator. <s8> the yolk nuclei, which remain in the core of the embryo when the rest of the nuclei migrate to the periphery, divide in synchrony with the migrating nuclei at nuclear cycles 8 and 9, and just after the now peripherally located nuclei at nuclear cycle 10. <s9> after cycle 10, these yolk nuclei cease dividing and become polyploid. <s10> the syncytial embryo has at least three distinct levels of cytoskeletal organization: structured domains of cytoplasm are organized around each blastoderm nucleus; radially directed tracks orient colchicine-sensitive saltatory transport throughout the peripheral cytoplasm; and a long-range organization of the core of the embryo makes possible coherent movements of the large inner yolk mass in concert with each nuclear cycle. <s11> this highly organized cytoplasm may be involved in providing positional information for the important process of nuclear determination that is known to occur during these stages.

lp+ss: Antiretroviral therapy increases rates of tuberculosis across a broad range of CD4 strata. <s0> all else being equal, polyploids are expected to have larger c-values (amount of dna in the unreplicated gametic nucleus) than their diploid progenitors, increasing in direct proportion with ploidy. <s1> this expectation is observed in some polyploid series, especially those newly formed, but there are examples suggesting that c-values in particular polyploids are less than expected. <s2> the availability of the angiosperm dna c-values database (http:// www.rbgkew.org.uk/cvavhomepage.html) has allowed this question to be addressed across a broad range of angiosperms and has revealed striking results deviating from expectation: (i) mean 1c dna amount did not increase in direct proportion with ploidy, and (ii) mean dna amount per basic genome (calculated by dividing the 2c value by ploidy) tended to decrease with increasing ploidy. <s3> these results suggest that loss of dna following polyploid formation, or genome downsizing, may be a widespread phenomenon of considerable biological significance. <s4> recent advances in our understanding of the molecular events that take place following polyploid formation together with new data on how dna amounts can both increase and decrease provide some insights into how genome downsizing may take place. <s5> the nature of the evolutionary forces that may be driving dna loss are also discussed. 
lp+ss: Antiretroviral therapy increases rates of tuberculosis across a broad range of CD4 strata. <s0> women with a history of hypertensive pregnancy are at greater risk for future cardiovascular events; however, the mechanisms for this increased risk are unknown. <s1> evidence suggests that an exercise stimulus unmasks latent hypertensive tendencies, identifying individuals at the greatest risk for developing cardiovascular disease. <s2> the current study examined the hypothesis that women with a hypertensive pregnancy history exhibit an augmented exercise pressor response. <s3> normotensive women with a history of healthy pregnancy (con; n = 9) and hypertensive pregnancy (hp+; n = 12) were studied during the mid-luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. <s4> heart rate (hr), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (sbp, dbp), and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (msna) were measured during a cold pressor test (cpt), and, following a sufficient period of recovery, during static handgrip to fatigue (shg) and post-exercise circulatory arrest (peca). <s5> the bp, hr, and msna responses to the cpt were similar between groups. <s6> the sbp response to shg and peca was similar between groups, but dbp and hr were significantly greater in hp+ women (both p < 0.05). <s7> msna burst frequency, but not burst incidence or total activity, tended to be elevated in hp+ women during the stressor (peak δ from baseline 31 ± 13 vs. 23 ± 13 bursts/min; p for group = 0.06). <s8> despite no clinical signs of cardiovascular disease or hypertension, women with a history of hypertensive pregnancy display an enhanced cardiovascular reactivity to an exercise stimulus compared to women with a healthy pregnancy history. <s9> this response may be indicative of impaired cardiovascular control that precedes the clinical manifestation of hypertension or cardiovascular events. 
lp+ss: Approximately 250,000 people are infected with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 in the United Kingdom. <s0> likelihood ratios are one of the best measures of diagnostic accuracy, although they are seldom used, because interpreting them requires a calculator to convert back and forth between "probability" and "odds" of disease. <s1> this article describes a simpler method of interpreting likelihood ratios, one that avoids calculators, nomograms, and conversions to "odds" of disease. <s2> several examples illustrate how the clinician can use this method to refine diagnostic decisions at the bedside. 
lp+ss: Assessing treatment adherence is more beneficial to clinical practice than measuring routine outcomes. <s0> rna interference is the most rapid method for generation of conditional knockdown mutants in trypanosoma brucei. <s1> the dual t7 promoter (pzjm) and the stem-loop vectors have been widely used to generate stable inducible rnai cell lines with the latter providing tighter regulatory control. <s2> however, the steps for cloning stem-loop constructs are cumbersome requiring either multiple cloning steps or multi-fragment ligation reactions. <s3> we report the development of a vector (ptryprnaigate) derived from plew100 that utilizes the gateway® recombination system to facilitate easy production of hairpin rna constructs. <s4> this approach allows the final stem-loop rnai construct to be generated from a single cloning step of the pcr-derived gene fragment followed by an in vitro recombination reaction. <s5> the new vector facilitates high-throughput applications for gene silencing and provides a tool for functional genomics in t. brucei.

lp+ss: Autophagy deficiency in the liver increases vulnerability to insulin resistance. <s0> despite growing interest and a recent surge in papers, the role of autophagy in glucose and lipid metabolism is unclear. <s1> we produced mice with skeletal muscle–specific deletion of atg7 (encoding autophagy-related 7). <s2> unexpectedly, these mice showed decreased fat mass and were protected from diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance; this phenotype was accompanied by increased fatty acid oxidation and browning of white adipose tissue (wat) owing to induction of fibroblast growth factor 21 (fgf21). <s3> mitochondrial dysfunction induced by autophagy deficiency increased fgf21 expression through induction of atf4, a master regulator of the integrated stress response. <s4> mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitors also induced fgf21 in an atf4-dependent manner. <s5> we also observed induction of fgf21, resistance to diet-induced obesity and amelioration of insulin resistance in mice with autophagy deficiency in the liver, another insulin target tissue. <s6> these findings suggest that autophagy deficiency and subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction promote fgf21 expression, a hormone we consequently term a 'mitokine', and together these processes promote protection from diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance.

lp+ss: Autophagy deficiency in the liver increases vulnerability to insulin resistance. <s0> membrane attack complex/perforin-like (macpf) proteins comprise the largest superfamily of pore-forming proteins, playing crucial roles in immunity and pathogenesis. <s1> soluble monomers assemble into large transmembrane pores via conformational transitions that remain to be structurally and mechanistically characterised. <s2> here we present an 11 å resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-em) structure of the two-part, fungal toxin pleurotolysin (ply), together with crystal structures of both components (the lipid binding plya protein and the pore-forming macpf component plyb). <s3> these data reveal a 13-fold pore 80 å in diameter and 100 å in height, with each subunit comprised of a plyb molecule atop a membrane bound dimer of plya. the resolution of the em map, together with biophysical and computational experiments, allowed confident assignment of subdomains in a macpf pore assembly. <s4> the major conformational changes in plyb are a ∼70° opening of the bent and distorted central β-sheet of the macpf domain, accompanied by extrusion and refolding of two α-helical regions into transmembrane β-hairpins (tmh1 and tmh2). <s5> we determined the structures of three different disulphide bond-trapped prepore intermediates. <s6> analysis of these data by molecular modelling and flexible fitting allows us to generate a potential trajectory of β-sheet unbending. <s7> the results suggest that macpf conformational change is triggered through disruption of the interface between a conserved helix-turn-helix motif and the top of tmh2. <s8> following their release we propose that the transmembrane regions assemble into β-hairpins via top down zippering of backbone hydrogen bonds to form the membrane-inserted β-barrel. <s9> the intermediate structures of the macpf domain during refolding into the β-barrel pore establish a structural paradigm for the transition from soluble monomer to pore, which may be conserved across the whole superfamily. <s10> the tmh2 region is critical for the release of both tmh clusters, suggesting why this region is targeted by endogenous inhibitors of macpf function. 
lp+ss: Autophagy deficiency in the liver increases vulnerability to insulin resistance. <s0> every organ depends on blood vessels for oxygen and nutrients, but the vasculature associated with individual organs can be structurally and molecularly diverse. <s1> the central nervous system (cns) vasculature consists of a tightly sealed endothelium that forms the blood-brain barrier, whereas blood vessels of other organs are more porous. <s2> wnt7a and wnt7b encode two wnt ligands produced by the neuroepithelium of the developing cns coincident with vascular invasion. <s3> using genetic mouse models, we found that these ligands directly target the vascular endothelium and that the cns uses the canonical wnt signaling pathway to promote formation and cns-specific differentiation of the organ's vasculature. 
lp+ss: B cells go though plasmablast differentiation and antibody production by continuous expression of EBI2. <s0> humoral immunity depends on both rapid and long-term antibody production against invading pathogens. <s1> this is achieved by the generation of spatially distinct extrafollicular plasmablast and follicular germinal center (gc) b cell populations, but the signals that guide responding b cells to these alternative compartments have not been fully elucidated. <s2> here, we show that expression of the orphan g protein-coupled receptor epstein-barr virus-induced gene 2 (ebi2, also known as gpr183) by activated b cells was essential for their movement to extrafollicular sites and induction of early plasmablast responses. <s3> conversely, downregulation of ebi2 enabled b cells to access the center of follicles and promoted efficient gc formation. <s4> ebi2 therefore provides a previously uncharacterized dimension to b cell migration that is crucial for coordinating rapid versus long-term antibody responses.

lp+ss: B cells go though plasmablast differentiation and antibody production by continuous expression of EBI2. <s0> background primary cervical screening with both human papillomavirus (hpv) dna testing and cytological examination of cervical cells with a pap test (cytology) has been evaluated in randomized clinical trials. <s1> because the vast majority of women with positive cytology are also hpv dna positive, screening strategies that use hpv dna testing as the primary screening test may be more effective.  <s2> methods we used the database from the intervention arm (n = 6,257 women) of a population-based randomized trial of double screening with cytology and hpv dna testing to evaluate the efficacy of 11 possible cervical screening strategies that are based on hpv dna testing alone, cytology alone, and hpv dna testing combined with cytology among women aged 32-38 years. <s3> the main outcome measures were sensitivity for detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse (cin3+) within 6 months of enrollment or at colposcopy for women with a persistent type-specific hpv infection and the number of screening tests and positive predictive value (ppv) for each screening strategy. <s4> all statistical tests were two-sided.  <s5> results compared with screening by cytology alone, double testing with cytology and for type-specific hpv persistence resulted in a 35% (95% confidence interval [ci] = 15% to 60%) increase in sensitivity to detect cin3+, without a statistically significant reduction in the ppv (relative ppv = 0.76, 95% ci = 0.52 to 1.10), but with more than twice as many screening tests needed. <s6> several strategies that incorporated screening for high-risk hpv subtypes were explored, but they resulted in reduced ppv compared with cytology. <s7> compared with cytology, primary screening with hpv dna testing followed by cytological triage and repeat hpv dna testing of hpv dna-positive women with normal cytology increased the cin3+ sensitivity by 30% (95% ci = 9% to 54%), maintained a high ppv (relative ppv = 0.87, 95% ci = 0.60 to 1.26), and resulted in a mere 12% increase in the number of screening tests (from 6,257 to 7,019 tests).  <s8> conclusions primary hpv dna-based screening with cytology triage and repeat hpv dna testing of cytology-negative women appears to be the most feasible cervical screening strategy. 
lp+ss: B3-Galectin decreases cell resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) by engaging the alternate KRAS-RalB signaling complex downstream of EGFR. <s0> tumour cells, with stem-like properties, are highly aggressive and often show drug resistance. <s1> here, we reveal that integrin αvβ3 serves as a marker of breast, lung and pancreatic carcinomas with stem-like properties that are highly resistant to receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib. <s2> this was observed in vitro and in mice bearing patient-derived tumour xenografts or in clinical specimens from lung cancer patients who had progressed on erlotinib. <s3> mechanistically, αvβ3, in the unliganded state, recruits kras and ralb to the tumour cell plasma membrane, leading to the activation of tbk1 and nf-κb. in fact, αvβ3 expression and the resulting kras–ralb–nf-κb pathway were both necessary and sufficient for tumour initiation, anchorage independence, self-renewal and erlotinib resistance. <s4> pharmacological targeting of this pathway with bortezomib reversed both tumour stemness and erlotinib resistance. <s5> these findings not only identify αvβ3 as a marker/driver of carcinoma stemness but also reveal a therapeutic strategy to sensitize such tumours to rtk inhibition. 
lp+ss: B3-Galectin increases cell resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) by engaging the alternate KRAS-RalB signaling complex downstream of EGFR. <s0> objective the aim of this study was to investigate whether diabetes and hypertension cause additive effects in the responses to various vasoconstrictor and vasodilator agents, in isolated perfused kidneys obtained from streptozotocin (stz)-diabetic wistar-kyoto (wky) rats and from diabetic spontaneously hypertensive rats (shr).  <s1> methods shr and wky rats were administered stz 55 mg/kg by intravenous injection into a lateral tail vein at age 12 weeks. <s2> eight weeks later the kidneys were isolated and perfused via the left renal artery with a physiological salt solution. <s3> renal perfusion pressure was measured continuously. <s4> concentration response curves were plotted for various vasoconstrictor and vasodilator agents.  <s5> results both the diabetic and the hypertensive state were associated with an increased wet kidney weight. <s6> the contractile responses of the renal arterial system to phenylephrine (phe), serotonin (5-ht) and angiotensin ii (ang ii) in terms both of the maximal rise in perfusion pressure (mmhg) and of the sensitivity (log ec50) were the same in preparations from diabetic wky rats and in those from normoglycaemic wky rats. <s7> the maximal contractile responses both to phe and to ang ii were enhanced in kidneys from shr compared with those in kidneys from their normotensive controls, whereas simultaneously occurring diabetes impaired this sensitization. <s8> after precontraction with 3 x 10(-6) mol/l phe both endothelium-dependent (methacholine) and endothelium-independent (sodium nitroprusside) vasodilator drugs caused the same vasodilator response in the preparations taken from the four groups of animals.  <s9> conclusion in isolated perfused kidneys obtained from stz-diabetic wky rats and shr, the isolated diabetic state did not influence the vasoconstriction caused by various agonists. <s10> however, the enhanced vascular reactivity in the hypertensive state was blunted by simultaneously occurring diabetes mellitus. <s11> endothelium-dependent and -independent vasorelaxation in this model was not affected neither by the hypertensive nor by the diabetic state. 
lp+ss: BCL-2 activation antagonizes the apoptotic effects of c-Myc. <s0> resistance to apoptosis, often achieved by the overexpression of antiapoptotic proteins, is common and perhaps required in the genesis of cancer. <s1> however, it remains uncertain whether apoptotic defects are essential for tumor maintenance. <s2> to test this, we generated mice expressing a conditional bcl-2 gene and constitutive c-myc that develop lymphoblastic leukemia. <s3> eliminating bcl-2 yielded rapid loss of leukemic cells and significantly prolonged survival, formally validating bcl-2 as a rational target for cancer therapy. <s4> loss of this single molecule resulted in cell death, despite or perhaps attributable to the presence of other oncogenic events. <s5> this suggests a generalizable model in which aberrations inherent to cancer generate tonic death signals that would otherwise kill the cell if not opposed by a requisite apoptotic defect(s).

lp+ss: BCL-2 activation antagonizes the apoptotic effects of c-Myc. <s0> lowering low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (ldl-c) is the primary target in the management of dyslipidemia in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease. <s1> however, patients who have achieved ldl-c levels below the currently recommended targets may still experience cardiovascular events. <s2> this may result, in part, from elevated triglyceride (tg) levels and low levels of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (hdl-c). <s3> low hdl-c and high tg levels are common and are recognized as independent risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. <s4> furthermore, atherogenic dyslipidemia, characterized by low levels of hdl-c, high tg, and small, dense ldl particles, is a typical phenotype of dyslipidemia in subjects with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. <s5> therefore, to reduce further the risk of coronary heart disease (chd), raising hdl-c and lowering tg may be the secondary therapeutic target for patients who achieve ldl-c levels below the currently recommended targets but are still at risk of chd. <s6> however, whether increasing hdl-c levels alone reduces chd has not yet been confirmed in large randomized clinical trials, and whether functional hdl is more important than hdl-c in reducing chd remains controversial. <s7> large chd endpoint trials that include many patients with diabetes are underway to compare combination treatments with statin and niacin, fibrates, or cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors with statin alone treatments. <s8> in this review, we discuss the rationale and importance of increasing hdl-c levels with and without lowering tg levels in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular events.

lp+ss: BLM gene encodes RecQ-class DNA helicase. <s0> the bloom's syndrome (bs) gene, blm, plays an important role in the maintenance of genomic stability in somatic cells. <s1> a candidate for blm was identified by direct selection of a cdna derived from a 250 kb segment of the genome to which blm had been assigned by somatic crossover point mapping. <s2> in this novel mapping method, cells were used from persons with bs that had undergone intragenic recombination within blm. <s3> cdna analysis of the candidate gene identified a 4437 bp cdna that encodes a 1417 amino acid peptide with homology to the recq helicases, a subfamily of dexh box-containing dna and rna helicases. <s4> the presence of chain-terminating mutations in the candidate gene in persons with bs proved that it was blm.

lp+ss: Bariatric surgery leads to negative outcomes in mental health. <s0> background the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that vasodilator responses of porcine coronary resistance arteries are increased by exercise training.  <s1> methods and results yucatan miniature swine were randomly divided into groups of exercise-trained (et) and sedentary (sed) control pigs. <s2> et pigs were placed on a progressive treadmill training program lasting 16 to 20 weeks, and sed pigs remained inactive during the same time period. <s3> coronary resistance arteries 64 to 157 microns in diameter were isolated for in vitro evaluation of relaxation responses to the endothelium-independent dilators sodium nitroprusside (1 x 10(-10) to 1 x 10(-4) mol/l) and adenosine (1 x 10(-10) to 1 x 10(-5) mol/l) and to bradykinin (1 x 10(-13) to 3 x 10(-7) mol/l), an endothelium-dependent agent. <s4> relaxation responses to adenosine and sodium nitroprusside were not altered by exercise training. <s5> endothelium-dependent relaxation to bradykinin was enhanced in coronary resistance arteries from et pigs (ic50: et, 0.07 +/- <s6> 0.02 nmol/l; sed, 1.59 +/- <s7> 0.09 nmol/l). <s8> to determine whether prostanoids and/or the nitric oxide synthase pathway were involved in the et-induced changes in bradykinin-induced vasodilation, responses to bradykinin were examined in coronary resistance arteries from both et and sed pigs in the presence of indomethacin and in the presence of nitro-monomethyl l-arginine (l-nmma). <s9> both indomethacin and l-nmma produced significant inhibition of the bradykinin-induced relaxation in vessels from both groups. <s10> despite decreased bradykinin-induced relaxation after indomethacin, bradykinin-induced vasodilation was still enhanced in vessels from the et group. <s11> l-nmma caused greater inhibition of the bradykinin-induced relaxation in coronary resistance arteries from et pigs relative to arteries from sed pigs and eliminated the training-induced enhancement of the bradykinin responses.  <s12> conclusions these results suggest that exercise training enhances bradykinin-induced vasodilation through increased endothelium-derived relaxing factor/nitric oxide production by the l-arginine/nitric oxide synthase pathway.

lp+ss: Bariatric surgery reduces postmenopausal breast cancer. <s0> objective islet-reactive cd8(+) t-cells play a key role in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes in the nod mouse. <s1> the predominant t-cell specificities change over time, but whether similar shifts also occur after clinical diagnosis and insulin treatment in type 1 diabetic patients is unknown.    <s2> research design and methods <s3> we took advantage of a recently validated islet-specific cd8(+) t-cell gamma-interferon enzyme-linked immunospot (isl8spot) assay to follow responses against preproinsulin (ppi), gad, insulinoma-associated protein 2 (ia-2), and islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit-related protein (igrp) epitopes in 15 hla-a2(+) adult type 1 diabetic patients close to diagnosis and at a second time point 7-16 months later.  <s4> results cd8(+) t-cell reactivities were less frequent at follow-up, as 28.6% of responses tested positive at type 1 diabetes diagnosis vs. 13.2% after a median of 11 months (p = 0.003). <s5> while gad and ia-2 autoantibody (aab) titers were unchanged in 75% of cases, the fraction of patients responding to ppi and/or gad epitopes by isl8spot decreased from 60-67 to 20% (p < 0.02). <s6> the previously subdominant ia-2(206-214) and igrp(265-273) peptides were newly targeted, thus becoming the immunodominant epitopes.  <s7> conclusions shifts both in frequency and in immunodominance of cd8(+) t-cell responses occur more rapidly than do changes in aab titers. <s8> these different kinetics may suggest complementary clinical applications for t-cell and aab measurements. 
lp+ss: Basophils promote disease development in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). <s0> in systemic lupus erythematosus (sle), self-reactive antibodies can target the kidney (lupus nephritis), leading to functional failure and possible mortality. <s1> we report that activation of basophils by autoreactive ige causes their homing to lymph nodes, promoting t helper type 2 (t(h)2) cell differentiation and enhancing the production of self-reactive antibodies that cause lupus-like nephritis in mice lacking the src family protein tyrosine kinase lyn (lyn(-/-) mice). <s2> individuals with sle also have elevated serum ige, self-reactive iges and activated basophils that express cd62 ligand (cd62l) and the major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class ii molecule human leukocyte antigen-dr (hla-dr), parameters that are associated with increased disease activity and active lupus nephritis. <s3> basophils were also present in the lymph nodes and spleen of subjects with sle. <s4> thus, in lyn(-/-) mice, basophils and ige autoantibodies amplify autoantibody production that leads to lupus nephritis, and in individuals with sle ige autoantibodies and activated basophils are factors associated with disease activity and nephritis.

lp+ss: Beta-band coherence is diminished for visible stimuli over invisible stimuli. <s0> significant endeavor has been applied to identify functional therapeutic targets in glioblastoma (gbm) to halt the growth of this aggressive cancer. <s1> we show that the receptor tyrosine kinase epha3 is frequently overexpressed in gbm and, in particular, in the most aggressive mesenchymal subtype. <s2> importantly, epha3 is highly expressed on the tumor-initiating cell population in glioma and appears critically involved in maintaining tumor cells in a less differentiated state by modulating mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. <s3> epha3 knockdown or depletion of epha3-positive tumor cells reduced tumorigenic potential to a degree comparable to treatment with a therapeutic radiolabelled epha3-specific monoclonal antibody. <s4> these results identify epha3 as a functional, targetable receptor in gbm. 
lp+ss: Beta-band coherence is diminished for visible stimuli over invisible stimuli. <s0> we compared conscious and nonconscious processing of briefly flashed words using a visual masking procedure while recording intracranial electroencephalogram (ieeg) in ten patients. <s1> nonconscious processing of masked words was observed in multiple cortical areas, mostly within an early time window (<300 ms), accompanied by induced gamma-band activity, but without coherent long-distance neural activity, suggesting a quickly dissipating feedforward wave. <s2> in contrast, conscious processing of unmasked words was characterized by the convergence of four distinct neurophysiological markers: sustained voltage changes, particularly in prefrontal cortex, large increases in spectral power in the gamma band, increases in long-distance phase synchrony in the beta range, and increases in long-range granger causality. <s3> we argue that all of those measures provide distinct windows into the same distributed state of conscious processing. <s4> these results have a direct impact on current theoretical discussions concerning the neural correlates of conscious access. 
lp+ss: BiP is a general endoplasmic reticulum stress marker. <s0> background type 1 diabetes mellitus is a chronic autoimmune disease caused by the pathogenic action of t lymphocytes on insulin-producing beta cells. <s1> previous clinical studies have shown that continuous immune suppression temporarily slows the loss of insulin production. <s2> preclinical studies suggested that a monoclonal antibody against cd3 could reverse hyperglycemia at presentation and induce tolerance to recurrent disease.  <s3> methods we studied the effects of a nonactivating humanized monoclonal antibody against cd3-hokt3gamma1(ala-ala)-on the loss of insulin production in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. <s4> within 6 weeks after diagnosis, 24 patients were randomly assigned to receive either a single 14-day course of treatment with the monoclonal antibody or no antibody and were studied during the first year of disease.  <s5> results treatment with the monoclonal antibody maintained or improved insulin production after one year in 9 of the 12 patients in the treatment group, whereas only 2 of the 12 controls had a sustained response (p=0.01). <s6> the treatment effect on insulin responses lasted for at least 12 months after diagnosis. <s7> glycosylated hemoglobin levels and insulin doses were also reduced in the monoclonal-antibody group. <s8> no severe side effects occurred, and the most common side effects were fever, rash, and anemia. <s9> clinical responses were associated with a change in the ratio of cd4+ t cells to cd8+ t cells 30 and 90 days after treatment.  <s10> conclusions treatment with hokt3gamma1(ala-ala) mitigates the deterioration in insulin production and improves metabolic control during the first year of type 1 diabetes mellitus in the majority of patients. <s11> the mechanism of action of the anti-cd3 monoclonal antibody may involve direct effects on pathogenic t cells, the induction of populations of regulatory cells, or both. 
lp+ss: BiP is a general endoplasmic reticulum stress marker. <s0> in many eukaryotes, rna-dependent rna polymerases (rdrps) play key roles in the rnai pathway. <s1> they have been implicated in the recognition and processing of aberrant transcripts triggering the process, and in amplification of the silencing response. <s2> we have tested the functions of rdrp genes from the ciliate paramecium tetraurelia in experimentally induced and endogenous mechanisms of gene silencing. <s3> in this organism, rnai can be triggered either by high-copy, truncated transgenes or by directly feeding cells with double-stranded rna (dsrna). <s4> surprisingly, dsrna-induced silencing depends on the putatively functional rdr1 and rdr2 genes, which are required for the accumulation of both primary sirnas and a distinct class of small rnas suggestive of secondary sirnas. <s5> in contrast, a third gene with a highly divergent catalytic domain, rdr3, is required for sirna accumulation when rnai is triggered by truncated transgenes. <s6> our data further implicate rdr3 in the accumulation of previously described endogenous sirnas and in the regulation of the surface antigen gene family. <s7> while only one of these genes is normally expressed in any clonal cell line, the knockdown of rdr3 leads to co-expression of multiple antigens. <s8> these results provide evidence for a functional specialization of paramecium rdrp genes in distinct rnai pathways operating during vegetative growth. 
lp+ss: Binding of p53 to enhancer regions (p53BERs) regulates the activity of p53 transcription and cell cycle arrest through the production of p53-dependent eRNAs. <s0> binding within or nearby target genes involved in cell proliferation and survival enables the p53 tumor suppressor gene to regulate their transcription and cell-cycle progression. <s1> using genome-wide chromatin-binding profiles, we describe binding of p53 also to regions located distantly from any known p53 target gene. <s2> interestingly, many of these regions possess conserved p53-binding sites and all known hallmarks of enhancer regions. <s3> we demonstrate that these p53-bound enhancer regions (p53bers) indeed contain enhancer activity and interact intrachromosomally with multiple neighboring genes to convey long-distance p53-dependent transcription regulation. <s4> furthermore, p53bers produce, in a p53-dependent manner, enhancer rnas (ernas) that are required for efficient transcriptional enhancement of interacting target genes and induction of a p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest. <s5> thus, our results ascribe transcription enhancement activity to p53 with the capacity to regulate multiple genes from a single genomic binding site. <s6> moreover, erna production from p53bers is required for efficient p53 transcription enhancement.

lp+ss: Binding of p53 to enhancer regions (p53BERs) regulates the activity of p53 transcription and cell cycle arrest through the production of p53-dependent eRNAs. <s0> impaired axonal transport in motor neurons has been proposed as a mechanism for neuronal degeneration in motor neuron disease. <s1> here we show linkage of a lower motor neuron disease to a region of 4 mb at chromosome 2p13. <s2> mutation analysis of a gene in this interval that encodes the largest subunit of the axonal transport protein dynactin showed a single base-pair change resulting in an amino-acid substitution that is predicted to distort the folding of dynactin's microtubule-binding domain. <s3> binding assays show decreased binding of the mutant protein to microtubules. <s4> our results show that dysfunction of dynactin-mediated transport can lead to human motor neuron disease.

lp+ss: Blocking the interaction between TDP-43 and respiratory complex I proteins ND3 and ND6 prevents TDP-43-induced neuronal loss. <s0> genetic mutations in tar dna-binding protein 43 (tardbp, also known as tdp-43) cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als), and an increase in the presence of tdp-43 (encoded by tardbp) in the cytoplasm is a prominent histopathological feature of degenerating neurons in various neurodegenerative diseases. <s1> however, the molecular mechanisms by which tdp-43 contributes to als pathophysiology remain elusive. <s2> here we have found that tdp-43 accumulates in the mitochondria of neurons in subjects with als or frontotemporal dementia (ftd). <s3> disease-associated mutations increase tdp-43 mitochondrial localization. <s4> in mitochondria, wild-type (wt) and mutant tdp-43 preferentially bind mitochondria-transcribed messenger rnas (mrnas) encoding respiratory complex i subunits nd3 and nd6, impair their expression and specifically cause complex i disassembly. <s5> the suppression of tdp-43 mitochondrial localization abolishes wt and mutant tdp-43-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal loss, and improves phenotypes of transgenic mutant tdp-43 mice. <s6> thus, our studies link tdp-43 toxicity directly to mitochondrial bioenergetics and propose the targeting of tdp-43 mitochondrial localization as a promising therapeutic approach for neurodegeneration.

lp+ss: Blocking the interaction between TDP-43 and respiratory complex I proteins ND3 and ND6 prevents TDP-43-induced neuronal loss. <s0> neural stem cells are precursors of neurons and glial cells. <s1> during brain development, these cells proliferate, migrate and differentiate into specific lineages. <s2> recently neural stem cells within the adult central nervous system were identified. <s3> informations are now emerging about regulation of stem cell proliferation, migration and differentiation by numerous soluble factors such as chemokines and cytokines. <s4> however, the signal transduction mechanisms downstream of these factors are less clear. <s5> here, we review potential evidences for a novel central role of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa b (nf-kappab) in these crucial signal transduction processes. <s6> nf-kappab is an inducible transcription factor detected in neurons, glia and neural stem cells. <s7> nf-kappab was discovered by david baltimore's laboratory as a transcription factor in lymphocytes. <s8> nf-kappab is involved in many biological processes such as inflammation and innate immunity, development, apoptosis and anti-apoptosis. <s9> it has been recently shown that members of the nf-kappab family are widely expressed by neurons, glia and neural stem cells. <s10> in the nervous system, nf-kappab plays a crucial role in neuronal plasticity, learning, memory consolidation, neuroprotection and neurodegeneration. <s11> recent data suggest an important role of nf-kappab on proliferation, migration and differentiation of neural stem cells. <s12> nf-kappab is composed of three subunits: two dna-binding and one inhibitory subunit. <s13> activation of nf-kappab takes place in the cytoplasm and results in degradation of the inhibitory subunit, thus enabling the nuclear import of the dna-binding subunits. <s14> within the nucleus, several target genes could be activated. <s15> in this review, we suggest a model explaining the multiple action of nf-kappab on neural stem cells. <s16> furthermore, we discuss the potential role of nf-kappab within the so-called brain cancer stem cells. 
lp+ss: Blocking the interaction between TDP-43 and respiratory complex I proteins ND3 and ND6 prevents TDP-43-induced neuronal loss. <s0> the architecture and adhesiveness of a cell microenvironment is a critical factor for the regulation of spindle orientation in vivo. <s1> using a combination of theory and experiments, we have investigated spindle orientation in hela (human) cells. <s2> here we show that spindle orientation can be understood as the result of the action of cortical force generators, which interact with spindle microtubules and are activated by cortical cues. <s3> we develop a simple physical description of this spindle mechanics, which allows us to calculate angular profiles of the torque acting on the spindle, as well as the angular distribution of spindle orientations. <s4> our model accounts for the preferred spindle orientation and the shape of the full angular distribution of spindle orientations observed in a large variety of different cellular microenvironment geometries. <s5> it also correctly describes asymmetric spindle orientations, which are observed for certain distributions of cortical cues. <s6> we conclude that, on the basis of a few simple assumptions, we can provide a quantitative description of the spindle orientation of adherent cells. 
lp+ss: Bone marrow cells don't contribute to adult macrophage compartments. <s0> despite accumulating evidence suggesting local self-maintenance of tissue macrophages in the steady state, the dogma remains that tissue macrophages derive from monocytes. <s1> using parabiosis and fate-mapping approaches, we confirmed that monocytes do not show significant contribution to tissue macrophages in the steady state. <s2> similarly, we found that after depletion of lung macrophages, the majority of repopulation occurred by stochastic cellular proliferation in situ in a macrophage colony-stimulating factor (m-csf)- and granulocyte macrophage (gm)-csf-dependent manner but independently of interleukin-4. <s3> we also found that after bone marrow transplantation, host macrophages retained the capacity to expand when the development of donor macrophages was compromised. <s4> expansion of host macrophages was functional and prevented the development of alveolar proteinosis in mice transplanted with gm-csf-receptor-deficient progenitors. <s5> collectively, these results indicate that tissue-resident macrophages and circulating monocytes should be classified as mononuclear phagocyte lineages that are independently maintained in the steady state.

lp+ss: British male students are bullied more than British female students. <s0> bullying is still prevalent in schools and is clearly stressful for victims. <s1> 1 2 it may also have undesirable consequences for bullies, with antisocial behaviour persisting into adulthood. <s2> victims are generally reported to be weaker than the bullies. <s3> 2 3 this would suggest that very short pupils are more likely to be victims and less likely to be the aggressors. <s4> the wessex growth study allowed us to examine the prevalence of bullying, as experienced or perpetrated by pupils of different heights.   <s5> ninety two short normal adolescents who had been below the third centile for height at school entry4 and 117 controls matched for age and sex completed a bullying questionnaire, derived from work by whitney and smith.5 there were no refusals or any significant differences in sex or social class between the groups. <s6> mean age (range) was 14.7 (13.4-15.7) years. <s7> mean height sd scores were: short pupils −1.90 (−3.53 to −0.01), controls 0.31 (−1.41 … 
lp+ss: Broadly HIV-1 Neutralizing Antibodies (bnAb) 10EB have no affinity for phospholipids. <s0> characterization of human monoclonal antibodies is providing considerable insight into mechanisms of broad hiv-1 neutralization. <s1> here we report an hiv-1 gp41 membrane-proximal external region (mper)-specific antibody, named 10e8, which neutralizes ∼98% of tested viruses. <s2> an analysis of sera from 78 healthy hiv-1-infected donors demonstrated that 27% contained mper-specific antibodies and 8% contained 10e8-like specificities. <s3> in contrast to other neutralizing mper antibodies, 10e8 did not bind phospholipids, was not autoreactive, and bound cell-surface envelope. <s4> the structure of 10e8 in complex with the complete mper revealed a site of vulnerability comprising a narrow stretch of highly conserved gp41-hydrophobic residues and a critical arginine or lysine just before the transmembrane region. <s5> analysis of resistant hiv-1 variants confirmed the importance of these residues for neutralization. <s6> the highly conserved mper is a target of potent, non-self-reactive neutralizing antibodies, suggesting that hiv-1 vaccines should aim to induce antibodies to this region of hiv-1 envelope glycoprotein.

lp+ss: CCL19 is a ligand for CCR7. <s0> chemokines orchestrate immune cell trafficking by eliciting either directed or random migration and by activating integrins in order to induce cell adhesion. <s1> analyzing dendritic cell (dc) migration, we showed that these distinct cellular responses depended on the mode of chemokine presentation within tissues. <s2> the surface-immobilized form of the chemokine ccl21, the heparan sulfate-anchoring ligand of the cc-chemokine receptor 7 (ccr7), caused random movement of dcs that was confined to the chemokine-presenting surface because it triggered integrin-mediated adhesion. <s3> upon direct contact with ccl21, dcs truncated the anchoring residues of ccl21, thereby releasing it from the solid phase. <s4> soluble ccl21 functionally resembles the second ccr7 ligand, ccl19, which lacks anchoring residues and forms soluble gradients. <s5> both soluble ccr7 ligands triggered chemotactic movement, but not surface adhesion. <s6> adhesive random migration and directional steering cooperate to produce dynamic but spatially restricted locomotion patterns closely resembling the cellular dynamics observed in secondary lymphoid organs.

lp+ss: CCL19 is a ligand for CCR7. <s0> transformations from one tissue type to another make up a well established set of phenomena that can be explained by the principles of developmental biology. <s1> although these phenomena might be rare in nature, we can now imagine the possibility of deliberately reprogramming cells from one tissue type to another by manipulating the expression of transcription factors. <s2> this approach could generate new therapies for many human diseases. 
lp+ss: CCL19 is predominantly present within dLNs. <s0> abstract intact hela cells can bind virions of poliovirus type 1 and can subsequently convert them to altered particles by incubation at 37°. <s1> altered particles sediment more slowly than virions, have lost vp-4, and are disrupted by sodium dodecyl sulfate, but their rna is intact and ribonuclease insensitive. <s2> these characteristics allow assay of altered particles and of particles that have released their rna, using nuclease digestion with or without sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment. <s3> with this simple assay procedure, quantitative parameters of binding and alteration can be measured. <s4> the binding-altering activity can be localized in plasma membranes, and pure membranes can be shown to carry out alteration. <s5> the membrane-bound activity is abolished by proteases and by nonionic detergents. <s6> only altered particles are formed by membranes; release of rna is not caused by membranes but is caused by intact cells. <s7> binding and alteration are processes that are closely associated; it is possible that alteration is a consequence of binding by multiple receptors in a fluid membrane. 
lp+ss: CD28 initiates tonic signaling in conventional T cells, which causes an exhaustion phenotype and limited efficiency. <s0> chimeric antigen receptors (cars) targeting cd19 have mediated dramatic antitumor responses in hematologic malignancies, but tumor regression has rarely occurred using cars targeting other antigens. <s1> it remains unknown whether the impressive effects of cd19 cars relate to greater susceptibility of hematologic malignancies to car therapies, or superior functionality of the cd19 car itself. <s2> we show that tonic car cd3-ζ phosphorylation, triggered by antigen-independent clustering of car single-chain variable fragments, can induce early exhaustion of car t cells that limits antitumor efficacy. <s3> such activation is present to varying degrees in all cars studied, except the highly effective cd19 car. <s4> we further determine that cd28 costimulation augments, whereas 4-1bb costimulation reduces, exhaustion induced by persistent car signaling. <s5> our results provide biological explanations for the antitumor effects of cd19 cars and for the observations that cd19 car t cells incorporating the 4-1bb costimulatory domain are more persistent than those incorporating cd28 in clinical trials.

lp+ss: CD28 signals regulate trafficking of murine auto-reactive T cells into target tissues. <s0> activation of self-reactive t cells and their trafficking to target tissues leads to autoimmune organ destruction. <s1> mice lacking the co-inhibitory receptor cytotoxic t lymphocyte antigen-4 (ctla-4) develop fatal autoimmunity characterized by lymphocytic infiltration into nonlymphoid tissues. <s2> here, we demonstrate that the cd28 co-stimulatory pathway regulates the trafficking of self-reactive ctla4(-/-) t cells to tissues. <s3> concurrent ablation of the cd28-activated tec family kinase itk does not block spontaneous t cell activation but instead causes self-reactive ctla4(-/-) t cells to accumulate in secondary lymphoid organs. <s4> despite excessive spontaneous t cell activation and proliferation in lymphoid organs, itk(-/-); ctla4(-/-) mice are otherwise healthy, mount antiviral immune responses and exhibit a long lifespan. <s5> we propose that itk specifically licenses autoreactive t cells to enter tissues to mount destructive immune responses. <s6> notably, itk inhibitors mimic the null mutant phenotype and also prevent pancreatic islet infiltration by diabetogenic t cells in mouse models of type 1 diabetes, highlighting their potential utility for the treatment of human autoimmune disorders.

lp+ss: CDK6 shows impaired binding to loss-of-function variants of p18 INK4C. <s0> we have developed a nonheuristic genome topography scan (gts) algorithm to characterize the patterns of genomic alterations in human glioblastoma (gbm), identifying frequent p18(ink4c) and p16(ink4a) codeletion. <s1> functional reconstitution of p18(ink4c) in gbm cells null for both p16(ink4a) and p18(ink4c) resulted in impaired cell-cycle progression and tumorigenic potential. <s2> conversely, rnai-mediated depletion of p18(ink4c) in p16(ink4a)-deficient primary astrocytes or established gbm cells enhanced tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. <s3> furthermore, acute suppression of p16(ink4a) in primary astrocytes induced a concomitant increase in p18(ink4c). <s4> together, these findings uncover a feedback regulatory circuit in the astrocytic lineage and demonstrate a bona fide tumor suppressor role for p18(ink4c) in human gbm wherein it functions cooperatively with other ink4 family members to constrain inappropriate proliferation. 
lp+ss: CDK6 shows improved binding to loss-of-function variants of p18 INK4C. <s0> genomic alterations leading to aberrant activation of cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) complexes drive the pathogenesis of many common human tumor types. <s1> in the case of glioblastoma multiforme (gbm), these alterations are most commonly due to homozygous deletion of p16(ink4a) and less commonly due to genomic amplifications of individual genes encoding cyclins or cdks. <s2> here, we describe deletion of the p18(ink4c) cdk inhibitor as a novel genetic alteration driving the pathogenesis of gbm. <s3> deletions of p18(ink4c) often occurred in tumors also harboring homozygous deletions of p16(ink4a). <s4> expression of p18(ink4c) was completely absent in 43% of gbm primary tumors studied by immunohistochemistry. <s5> lentiviral reconstitution of p18(ink4c) expression at physiologic levels in p18(ink4c)-deficient but not p18(ink4c)-proficient gbm cells led to senescence-like g(1) cell cycle arrest. <s6> these studies identify p18(ink4c) as a gbm tumor suppressor gene, revealing an additional mechanism leading to aberrant activation of cyclin/cdk complexes in this terrible malignancy. 
lp+ss: CDK6 shows improved binding to loss-of-function variants of p18 INK4C. <s0> inhibition of αvβ3 or αvβ5 integrin function has been reported to suppress neovascularization and tumor growth, suggesting that these integrins are critical modulators of angiogenesis. <s1> here we report that mice lacking β3 integrins or both β3 and β5 integrins not only support tumorigenesis, but have enhanced tumor growth as well. <s2> moreover, the tumors in these integrin-deficient mice display enhanced angiogenesis, strongly suggesting that neither β3 nor β5 integrins are essential for neovascularization. <s3> we also observed that angiogenic responses to hypoxia and vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) are augmented significantly in the absence of β3 integrins. <s4> we found no evidence that the expression or functions of other integrins were altered as a consequence of the β3 deficiency, but we did observe elevated levels of vegf receptor-2 (also called flk-1) in β3-null endothelial cells. <s5> these data indicate that αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins are not essential for vascular development or pathological angiogenesis and highlight the need for further evaluation of the mechanisms of action of αv-integrin antagonists in anti-angiogenic therapeutics. 
lp+ss: CHOP is a general endoplasmic reticulum stress marker. <s0> rationale, aims and objectives following increased interest in having inter-professional (ip) health care teams engage patients in decision making, we developed a conceptual model for an ip approach to shared decision making (sdm) in primary care. <s1> we assessed the validity of the model with stakeholders in canada.  <s2> methods in 15 individual interviews and 7 group interviews with 79 stakeholders, we asked them to: (1) propose changes to the ip-sdm model; (2) identify barriers and facilitators to the model's implementation in clinical practice; and (3) assess the model using a theory appraisal questionnaire. <s3> we performed a thematic analysis of the transcripts and a descriptive analysis of the questionnaires.  <s4> results stakeholders suggested placing the patient at its centre; extending the concept of family to include significant others; clarifying outcomes; highlighting the concept of time; merging the micro, meso and macro levels in one figure; and recognizing the influence of the environment and emotions. <s5> the most common barriers identified were time constraints, insufficient resources and an imbalance of power among health professionals. <s6> the most common facilitators were education and training in inter-professionalism and sdm, motivation to achieve an ip approach to sdm, and mutual knowledge and understanding of disciplinary roles. <s7> most stakeholders considered that the concepts and relationships between the concepts were clear and rated the model as logical, testable, having clear schematic representation, and being relevant to inter-professional collaboration, sdm and primary care.  <s8> conclusions stakeholders validated the new ip-sdm model for primary care settings and proposed few modifications. <s9> future research should assess if the model helps implement sdm in ip clinical practice. 
lp+ss: CHOP is a general endoplasmic reticulum stress marker. <s0> high doses of ionizing radiation clearly produce deleterious consequences in humans, including, but not exclusively, cancer induction. <s1> at very low radiation doses the situation is much less clear, but the risks of low-dose radiation are of societal importance in relation to issues as varied as screening tests for cancer, the future of nuclear power, occupational radiation exposure, frequent-flyer risks, manned space exploration, and radiological terrorism. <s2> we review the difficulties involved in quantifying the risks of low-dose radiation and address two specific questions. <s3> first, what is the lowest dose of x- or gamma-radiation for which good evidence exists of increased cancer risks in humans? <s4> the epidemiological data suggest that it is approximately 10-50 msv for an acute exposure and approximately 50-100 msv for a protracted exposure. <s5> second, what is the most appropriate way to extrapolate such cancer risk estimates to still lower doses? <s6> given that it is supported by experimentally grounded, quantifiable, biophysical arguments, a linear extrapolation of cancer risks from intermediate to very low doses currently appears to be the most appropriate methodology. <s7> this linearity assumption is not necessarily the most conservative approach, and it is likely that it will result in an underestimate of some radiation-induced cancer risks and an overestimate of others. 
lp+ss: COPI coatmer is involved in lipid homeostasis. <s0> lipid droplets are ubiquitous triglyceride and sterol ester storage organelles required for energy storage homeostasis and biosynthesis. <s1> although little is known about lipid droplet formation and regulation, it is clear that members of the pat (perilipin, adipocyte differentiation related protein, tail interacting protein of 47 kda) protein family coat the droplet surface and mediate interactions with lipases that remobilize the stored lipids. <s2> we identified key drosophila candidate genes for lipid droplet regulation by rna interference (rnai) screening with an image segmentation-based optical read-out system, and show that these regulatory functions are conserved in the mouse. <s3> those include the vesicle-mediated coat protein complex i (copi) transport complex, which is required for limiting lipid storage. <s4> we found that copi components regulate the pat protein composition at the lipid droplet surface, and promote the association of adipocyte triglyceride lipase (atgl) with the lipid droplet surface to mediate lipolysis. <s5> two compounds known to inhibit copi function, exo1 and brefeldin a, phenocopy copi knockdowns. <s6> furthermore, rnai inhibition of atgl and simultaneous drug treatment indicate that copi and atgl function in the same pathway. <s7> these data indicate that the copi complex is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of lipid homeostasis, and highlight an interaction between vesicle transport systems and lipid droplets.

lp+ss: COPI coatmer is involved in lipid homeostasis. <s0> the ability to maintain a functional proteome, or proteostasis, declines during the ageing process. <s1> damaged and misfolded proteins accumulate with age, impairing cell function and tissue homeostasis. <s2> the accumulation of damaged proteins contributes to multiple age-related diseases such as alzheimer's, parkinson's or huntington's disease. <s3> damaged proteins are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system or through autophagy-lysosome, key components of the proteostasis network. <s4> modulation of either proteasome activity or autophagic-lysosomal potential extends lifespan and protects organisms from symptoms associated with proteostasis disorders, suggesting that protein clearance mechanisms are directly linked to ageing and age-associated diseases. 
lp+ss: COPI coatmer is involved in viral replication. <s0> all else being equal, polyploids are expected to have larger c-values (amount of dna in the unreplicated gametic nucleus) than their diploid progenitors, increasing in direct proportion with ploidy. <s1> this expectation is observed in some polyploid series, especially those newly formed, but there are examples suggesting that c-values in particular polyploids are less than expected. <s2> the availability of the angiosperm dna c-values database (http:// www.rbgkew.org.uk/cvavhomepage.html) has allowed this question to be addressed across a broad range of angiosperms and has revealed striking results deviating from expectation: (i) mean 1c dna amount did not increase in direct proportion with ploidy, and (ii) mean dna amount per basic genome (calculated by dividing the 2c value by ploidy) tended to decrease with increasing ploidy. <s3> these results suggest that loss of dna following polyploid formation, or genome downsizing, may be a widespread phenomenon of considerable biological significance. <s4> recent advances in our understanding of the molecular events that take place following polyploid formation together with new data on how dna amounts can both increase and decrease provide some insights into how genome downsizing may take place. <s5> the nature of the evolutionary forces that may be driving dna loss are also discussed. 
lp+ss: Ca2+ cycling controls whole-body energy homeostasis in beige fat. <s0> uncoupling protein 1 (ucp1) plays a central role in nonshivering thermogenesis in brown fat; however, its role in beige fat remains unclear. <s1> here we report a robust ucp1-independent thermogenic mechanism in beige fat that involves enhanced atp-dependent ca2+ cycling by sarco/endoplasmic reticulum ca2+-atpase 2b (serca2b) and ryanodine receptor 2 (ryr2). <s2> inhibition of serca2b impairs ucp1-independent beige fat thermogenesis in humans and mice as well as in pigs, a species that lacks a functional ucp1 protein. <s3> conversely, enhanced ca2+ cycling by activation of α1- and/or β3-adrenergic receptors or the serca2b-ryr2 pathway stimulates ucp1-independent thermogenesis in beige adipocytes. <s4> in the absence of ucp1, beige fat dynamically expends glucose through enhanced glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid metabolism and pyruvate dehydrogenase activity for atp-dependent thermogenesis through the serca2b pathway; beige fat thereby functions as a 'glucose sink' and improves glucose tolerance independently of body weight loss. <s5> our study uncovers a noncanonical thermogenic mechanism through which beige fat controls whole-body energy homeostasis via ca2+ cycling.

lp+ss: Ca2+ cycling controls whole-body energy homeostasis in beige fat. <s0> microbial survival in a host is usually dependent on the ability of a pathogen to undergo changes that promote escape from host defense mechanisms. <s1> the human-pathogenic fungus cryptococcus neoformans undergoes phenotypic switching in vivo that promotes persistence in tissue. <s2> by microarray and real-time pcr analyses, the allergen 1 gene (all1) was found to be downregulated in the hypervirulent mucoid switch variant, both during logarithmic growth and during intracellular growth in macrophages. <s3> the all1 gene encodes a small cytoplasmic protein that is involved in capsule formation. <s4> growth of an all1delta gene deletion mutant was normal. <s5> similar to cells of the mucoid switch variant, all1delta cells produced a larger polysaccharide capsule than cells of the smooth parent and the complemented strain produced, and the enlarged capsule inhibited macrophage phagocytosis. <s6> the mutant exhibited a modest defect in capsule induction compared to all of the other variants. <s7> in animal models the phenotype of the all1delta mutant mimicked the hypervirulent phenotype of the mucoid switch variant, which is characterized by decreased host survival and elevated intracranial pressure. <s8> decreased survival is likely the result of both an ineffective cell-mediated immune response and impaired phagocytosis by macrophages. <s9> consequently, we concluded that, unlike loss of most virulence-associated genes, where loss of gene function results in attenuated virulence, loss of the all1 gene enhances virulence by altering the host-pathogen interaction and thereby impairing clearance. <s10> our data identified the first cryptococcal gene associated with elevated intracranial pressure and support the hypothesis that an environmental opportunistic pathogen has modified its virulence in vivo by epigenetic downregulation of gene function.

lp+ss: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are constituents of tumor microenvironments <s0> cancers develop in complex tissue environments, which they depend on for sustained growth, invasion and metastasis. <s1> unlike tumor cells, stromal cell types within the tumor microenvironment (tme) are genetically stable and thus represent an attractive therapeutic target with reduced risk of resistance and tumor recurrence. <s2> however, specifically disrupting the pro-tumorigenic tme is a challenging undertaking, as the tme has diverse capacities to induce both beneficial and adverse consequences for tumorigenesis. <s3> furthermore, many studies have shown that the microenvironment is capable of normalizing tumor cells, suggesting that re-education of stromal cells, rather than targeted ablation per se, may be an effective strategy for treating cancer. <s4> here we discuss the paradoxical roles of the tme during specific stages of cancer progression and metastasis, as well as recent therapeutic attempts to re-educate stromal cells within the tme to have anti-tumorigenic effects. 
lp+ss: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are constituents of tumor microenvironments <s0> we investigated the capacity of young ovaries, transplanted into old ovariectomized cba mice, to improve remaining life expectancy of the hosts. <s1> donor females were sexually mature 2-month-olds; recipients were prepubertally ovariectomized at 3 weeks and received transplants at 5, 8 or 11 months of age. <s2> relative to ovariectomized control females, life expectancy at 11 months was increased by 60% in 11-month recipient females and by 40% relative to intact control females. <s3> only 20% of the 11-month transplant females died in the 300-day period following ovarian transplantation, whereas nearly 65% of the ovariectomized control females died during this same period. <s4> the 11-month-old recipient females resumed oestrus and continued to cycle up to several months beyond the age of control female reproductive senescence. <s5> across the three recipient age groups, transplantation of young ovaries increased life expectancy in proportion to the relative youth of the ovary. <s6> our results relate to recent findings on the gonadal input upon aging in caenorhabditis elegans and may suggest how the mammalian gonad, including that of humans, could regulate aging and determine longevity. 
lp+ss: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are constituents of tumor microenvironments <s0> subunits of the swi/snf chromatin remodeling complex are mutated in a significant proportion of human cancers. <s1> malignant rhabdoid tumors (mrts) are lethal pediatric cancers characterized by a deficiency in the swi/snf subunit smarcb1. <s2> here, we employ an integrated molecular profiling and chemical biology approach to demonstrate that the receptor tyrosine kinases (rtks) pdgfrα and fgfr1 are coactivated in mrt cells and that dual blockade of these receptors has synergistic efficacy. <s3> inhibitor combinations targeting both receptors and the dual inhibitor ponatinib suppress the akt and erk1/2 pathways leading to apoptosis. <s4> mrt cells that have acquired resistance to the pdgfrα inhibitor pazopanib are susceptible to fgfr inhibitors. <s5> we show that pdgfrα levels are regulated by smarcb1 expression, and assessment of clinical specimens documents the expression of both pdgfrα and fgfr1 in rhabdoid tumor patients. <s6> our findings support a therapeutic approach in cancers with swi/snf deficiencies by exploiting rtk coactivation dependencies.

lp+ss: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) interact with cancer cells to mediate formation and activation of CAFs. <s0> background antiresorptive agents are widely used to treat osteoporosis. <s1> we report the results of a multinational randomized, double-blind study, in which postmenopausal women with osteoporosis were treated with alendronate for up to 10 years.  <s2> methods the initial three-year phase of the study compared three daily doses of alendronate with placebo. <s3> women in the original placebo group received alendronate in years 4 and 5 and then were discharged. <s4> women in the original active-treatment groups continued to receive alendronate during the initial extension (years 4 and 5). <s5> in two further extensions (years 6 and 7, and 8 through 10), women who had received 5 mg or 10 mg of alendronate daily continued on the same treatment. <s6> women in the discontinuation group received 20 mg of alendronate daily for two years and 5 mg daily in years 3, 4, and 5, followed by five years of placebo. <s7> randomized group assignments and blinding were maintained throughout the 10 years. <s8> we report results for the 247 women who participated in all four phases of the study.  <s9> results treatment with 10 mg of alendronate daily for 10 years produced mean increases in bone mineral density of 13.7 percent at the lumbar spine (95 percent confidence interval, 12.0 to 15.5 percent), 10.3 percent at the trochanter (95 percent confidence interval, 8.1 to 12.4 percent), 5.4 percent at the femoral neck (95 percent confidence interval, 3.5 to 7.4 percent), and 6.7 percent at the total proximal femur (95 percent confidence interval, 4.4 to 9.1 percent) as compared with base-line values; smaller gains occurred in the group given 5 mg daily. <s10> the discontinuation of alendronate resulted in a gradual loss of effect, as measured by bone density and biochemical markers of bone remodeling. <s11> safety data, including fractures and stature, did not suggest that prolonged treatment resulted in any loss of benefit.  <s12> conclusions the therapeutic effects of alendronate were sustained, and the drug was well tolerated over a 10-year period. <s13> the discontinuation of alendronate resulted in the gradual loss of its effects. 
lp+ss: Cancers that initially benefit from epidermal growth factor receptor targeted therapies later become refractory through several mechanisms. <s0> all patients with metastatic lung, colorectal, pancreatic or head and neck cancers who initially benefit from epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr)-targeted therapies eventually develop resistance. <s1> an increasing understanding of the number and complexity of resistance mechanisms highlights the herculean challenge of killing tumors that are resistant to egfr inhibitors. <s2> our growing knowledge of resistance pathways provides an opportunity to develop new mechanism-based inhibitors and combination therapies to prevent or overcome therapeutic resistance in tumors. <s3> we present a comprehensive review of resistance pathways to egfr-targeted therapies in lung, colorectal and head and neck cancers and discuss therapeutic strategies that are designed to circumvent resistance.

lp+ss: Cancers that initially benefit from epidermal growth factor receptor targeted therapies later become refractory through several mechanisms. <s0> the frontal lobe is the largest lobe of the brain, and it is thus commonly involved in stroke. <s1> moreover, almost one in five strokes is limited to the prerolandic areas. <s2> this high frequency of anatomical involvement is in sharp contrast with the apparent rarity of clinical frontal dysfunction in stroke. <s3> it is remarkable that frontal behavioral syndromes have been rather uncommonly reported in patients with stroke as compared to patients with other diseases, such as brain tumor. <s4> this fact is paradoxical, because an acute process (stroke) is expected to yield more clinical dysfunction than a more chronic disease (tumor). <s5> a volume effect may be the main factor leading to this phenomenon. <s6> another interesting aspect of frontal strokes is the contribution of so-called 'silent' strokes, the recurrence of which may nevertheless lead to intellectual decline and compromise recovery from another stroke with more specific neurologic dysfunction. <s7> the contribution of stroke to understanding of frontal lobe dysfunction is important, because of the focal nature of this disease, and great opportunity for clinical-topographic classification correlations. <s8> one of the first modern attempts to develop a clinical-topographic classification of frontal lobe lesions came from the school of luria, who tried to delineate three main types of frontal lobe syndromes (premotor syndrome, prefrontal syndrome, medial-frontal syndrome). <s9> recent anatomic correlates using mri make it possible to improve this classification. <s10> we suggest considering six main clinical-anatomic frontal stroke syndromes: (1) prefrontal; (2) premotor; (3) superior medial; (4) orbital-medial; (5) basal forebrain; (6) white matter. <s11> finally, another fascinating topic relates to frontal lobe symptomatology due to stroke sparing the frontal cortex or white matter. <s12> this occurs mainly in three instances: lenticulo-capsular stroke, caudate stroke, and thalamic stroke. <s13> studies using blood flow or metabolism measurements suggest that diaschisis (frontal lobe dysfunction from a remote lesion) may play a role. <s14> we believe that this is more likely to be related to dynamic interruption of complex circuitry than to static frontal lobe deactivation. 
lp+ss: Cardiac tissue-resident macrophages directly contribute to electrical activity. <s0> organ-specific functions of tissue-resident macrophages in the steady-state heart are unknown. <s1> here, we show that cardiac macrophages facilitate electrical conduction through the distal atrioventricular node, where conducting cells densely intersperse with elongated macrophages expressing connexin 43. <s2> when coupled to spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes via connexin-43-containing gap junctions, cardiac macrophages have a negative resting membrane potential and depolarize in synchrony with cardiomyocytes. <s3> conversely, macrophages render the resting membrane potential of cardiomyocytes more positive and, according to computational modeling, accelerate their repolarization. <s4> photostimulation of channelrhodopsin-2-expressing macrophages improves atrioventricular conduction, whereas conditional deletion of connexin 43 in macrophages and congenital lack of macrophages delay atrioventricular conduction. <s5> in the cd11bdtr mouse, macrophage ablation induces progressive atrioventricular block. <s6> these observations implicate macrophages in normal and aberrant cardiac conduction.

lp+ss: Cardiac tissue-resident macrophages directly contribute to electrical activity. <s0> adult t-cell leukaemia lymphoma (atll) is an aggressive disease caused by the human t-lymphotropic virus 1 (htlv-i) with a short survival. <s1> responses to interferon alpha (ifn-alpha) and zidovudine (azt) have been documented but not with long-term follow-up. <s2> we treated 15 atll patients with ifn and azt. <s3> eleven patients had acute atll, two had lymphoma and two smouldering atll, with progression. <s4> the main features were: organomegaly (14), skin lesions (10), high white blood cell (wbc) count (11) and hypercalcaemia (9). <s5> eleven patients had previously received chemotherapy and one had received an autograft. <s6> at the time of the study, seven patients had progressive disease and eight were in partial or complete clinical remission. <s7> responses (pr) lasting 2+ to 44+ months were seen in 67%; 26% did not respond (nr) and one patient was not evaluable. <s8> hypercalcaemia predicted a poor outcome but differences were not significant. <s9> eight of the 15 patients have died 3-41 months from diagnosis. <s10> median survival for the 15 patients was 18 months. <s11> survival of the nr ranged from 4 to 20 months; six pr patients are alive 8-82 months from diagnosis. <s12> the differences in survival between nr (median: 6 months) and pr (55% of patients alive at 4 years) were statistically significant (p = 0.002). <s13> in conclusion, ifn and azt improves the outcome of atll patients and helps maintain responses. 
lp+ss: Cardiac tissue-resident macrophages directly contribute to electrical activity. <s0> dna double-strand breaks (dsbs) are repaired via nonhomologous end-joining (nhej) or homologous recombination (hr), but cellular repair processes remain elusive. <s1> we show here that the atp-dependent chromatin-remodeling factors, acf1 and snf2h, accumulate rapidly at dsbs and are required for dsb repair in human cells. <s2> if the expression of acf1 or snf2h is suppressed, cells become extremely sensitive to x-rays and chemical treatments producing dsbs, and dsbs remain unrepaired. <s3> acf1 interacts directly with ku70 and is required for the accumulation of ku proteins at dsbs. <s4> the ku70/80 complex becomes physically more associated with the chromatin-remodeling factors of the chrac complex, which includes acf1, snf2h, chrac15, and chrac17, after treatments producing dsbs. <s5> furthermore, the frequency of nhej as well as hr induced by dsbs in chromosomal dna is significantly decreased in cells depleted of either of these factors. <s6> thus, acf1 and its complexes play important roles in dsbs repair. 
lp+ss: Carriers of HNF4A mutations are at reduced risk for diabetes. <s0> integrins, a large family of cell adhesion receptors, have been shown to play an important role for glioma proliferation and invasion. <s1> several integrin receptors, including αvβ3, αvβ5, and α5β1, have generated clinical interest for glioma diagnosis and antitumor therapy. <s2> integrin α5β1 has been highlighted as a prognostic and diagnostic marker in glioma, and its expression is correlated with a worse prognosis in high-grade glioma. <s3> however, unlike extensively studied integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5, very few integrin α5β1-specific radiotracers have been reported. <s4> developing α5β1-specific radiotracers may provide alternative diagnosis and evaluation options in addition to well-studied αvβ3/αvβ5-specific tracers, and they may add new documents for profiling tumor progression. <s5> here, a novel integrin α5β1-specific probe (99m)tc-hisodgr was fabricated for spect (single-photon emission computed tomography) imaging of glioma. <s6> to confirm its selective targeting of integrin α5β1 in vivo, the mouse models of α5β1-positive u87mg human glioma were subjected to spect/ct scans, and biodistribution experiments and blocking studies were performed. <s7> small-animal spect/ct imaging experiments demonstrated that the tumors were clearly visualized in both subcutaneous and orthotopic glioma tumor models with clear background at 0.5, 1, and 2 h p.i. <s8> the tumor accumulation of (99m)tc-hisodgr showed significant reduction when excess cold isodgr peptide was coinjected, suggesting that the tumor uptake was specifically mediated. <s9> our work revealed that (99m)tc-hisodgr represented a powerful molecular probe for integrin α5β1-positive cancer imaging; moreover, it might be a promising tool for evaluating malignancy, predicting prognosis, selecting subpopulations of patients who might be sensitive to integrin α5β1-targeted drugs, and assessing and monitoring the response to integrin α5β1-targeted drugs in clinical trials. 
lp+ss: Carriers of HNF4A mutations are at reduced risk for diabetes. <s0> background  macrosomia is associated with considerable neonatal and maternal morbidity. <s1> factors that predict macrosomia are poorly understood. <s2> the increased rate of macrosomia in the offspring of pregnant women with diabetes and in congenital hyperinsulinaemia is mediated by increased foetal insulin secretion. <s3> we assessed the in utero and neonatal role of two key regulators of pancreatic insulin secretion by studying birthweight and the incidence of neonatal hypoglycaemia in patients with heterozygous mutations in the maturity-onset diabetes of the young (mody) genes hnf4a (encoding hnf-4α) and hnf1a/tcf1 (encoding hnf-1α), and the effect of pancreatic deletion of hnf4a on foetal and neonatal insulin secretion in mice. 
lp+ss: Cell autonomous sex determination in somatic cells occurs in Galliformes. <s0> in the mammalian model of sex determination, embryos are considered to be sexually indifferent until the transient action of a sex-determining gene initiates gonadal differentiation. <s1> although this model is thought to apply to all vertebrates, this has yet to be established. <s2> here we have examined three lateral gynandromorph chickens (a rare, naturally occurring phenomenon in which one side of the animal appears male and the other female) to investigate the sex-determining mechanism in birds. <s3> these studies demonstrated that gynandromorph birds are genuine male:female chimaeras, and indicated that male and female avian somatic cells may have an inherent sex identity. <s4> to test this hypothesis, we transplanted presumptive mesoderm between embryos of reciprocal sexes to generate embryos containing male:female chimaeric gonads. <s5> in contrast to the outcome for mammalian mixed-sex chimaeras, in chicken mixed-sex chimaeras the donor cells were excluded from the functional structures of the host gonad. <s6> in an example where female tissue was transplanted into a male host, donor cells contributing to the developing testis retained a female identity and expressed a marker of female function. <s7> our study demonstrates that avian somatic cells possess an inherent sex identity and that, in birds, sexual differentiation is substantively cell autonomous.

lp+ss: Cellular clocks are associated with mitosis timing in NIH 3T3 cells. <s0> circadian cycles and cell cycles are two fundamental periodic processes with a period in the range of 1 day. <s1> consequently, coupling between such cycles can lead to synchronization. <s2> here, we estimated the mutual interactions between the two oscillators by time-lapse imaging of single mammalian nih3t3 fibroblasts during several days. <s3> the analysis of thousands of circadian cycles in dividing cells clearly indicated that both oscillators tick in a 1:1 mode-locked state, with cell divisions occurring tightly 5 h before the peak in circadian rev-erbα-yfp reporter expression. <s4> in principle, such synchrony may be caused by either unidirectional or bidirectional coupling. <s5> while gating of cell division by the circadian cycle has been most studied, our data combined with stochastic modeling unambiguously show that the reverse coupling is predominant in nih3t3 cells. <s6> moreover, temperature, genetic, and pharmacological perturbations showed that the two interacting cellular oscillators adopt a synchronized state that is highly robust over a wide range of parameters. <s7> these findings have implications for circadian function in proliferative tissues, including epidermis, immune cells, and cancer.

lp+ss: Cellular clocks are associated with mitosis timing in NIH 3T3 cells. <s0> we describe a technique for rapid labeling of a large number of cells in the nervous system with many different colors. <s1> by delivering lipophilic dye-coated particles to neuronal preparations with a "gene gun," individual neurons and glia whose membranes are contacted by the particles are quickly labeled. <s2> using particles that are each coated with different combinations of various lipophilic dyes, many cells within a complex neuronal network can be simultaneously labeled with a wide variety of colors. <s3> this approach is most effective in living material but also labels previously fixed material. <s4> in living material, labeled neurons continue to show normal synaptic responses and undergo dendritic remodeling. <s5> this technique is thus useful for studying structural plasticity of neuronal circuits in living preparations. <s6> in addition, the golgi-like labeling of neurons with many different colors provides a novel way to study neuronal connectivity.

lp+ss: Certain immunomodulator-human dialyzable leukocyte extract (hDLE) peptides are recognized by toll-like receptors (TLRs) on macrophages and dendritic cells. <s0> in the 20th century industrialized nations have become afflicted with an unprecedented pandemic of increased adiposity. <s1> in the united states, the epicenter of the epidemic, over 2/3 of the population, is overweight and 1 of every 6 americans carries the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome. <s2> although genes determine susceptibility to environmental factors, the epidemic is clearly due to increased consumption of calorie-dense, highly lipogenic foods, coupled with a marked decrease in physical exertion resulting from modern technologies. <s3> if this lifestyle continues, morbid consequences are virtually inevitable. <s4> they include type ii diabetes and a cluster of disorders known as "the metabolic syndrome" usually appearing in middle age. <s5> the morbid consequences of the chronic caloric surplus are buffered before middle age by the partitioning of these calories as fat in the adipocyte compartment which is specifically designed to store triglycerides. <s6> leptin has been proposed as the major hormonal regulator of the partitioning of surplus calories. <s7> however, multiple factors can determine the storage capacity of the fat tissue and when it is exceeded ectopic lipid deposition begins. <s8> the organs affected in metabolic syndrome include skeletal muscle, liver, heart and pancreas, which are now known to contain abnormal levels of triglycerides. <s9> while neutral fat is probably harmless, it is an index of ectopic lipid overload. <s10> fatty acid derivatives can interfere with the function of the cell and ultimately lead to its demise through lipoapoptosis, the consequences of which are gradual organ failure. 
lp+ss: Certain immunomodulator-human dialyzable leukocyte extract (hDLE) peptides are recognized by toll-like receptors (TLRs) on macrophages and dendritic cells. <s0> many fundamental aspects of dna replication, such as the exact locations where dna synthesis is initiated and terminated, how frequently origins are used, and how fork progression is influenced by transcription, are poorly understood. <s1> via the deep sequencing of okazaki fragments, we comprehensively document replication fork directionality throughout the s. cerevisiae genome, which permits the systematic analysis of initiation, origin efficiency, fork progression, and termination. <s2> we show that leading-strand initiation preferentially occurs within a nucleosome-free region at replication origins. <s3> using a strain in which late origins can be induced to fire early, we show that replication termination is a largely passive phenomenon that does not rely on cis-acting sequences or replication fork pausing. <s4> the replication profile is predominantly determined by the kinetics of origin firing, allowing us to reconstruct chromosome-wide timing profiles from an asynchronous culture.

lp+ss: Chenodeoxycholic acid treatment decreases brown adipose tissue activity. <s0> testosterone (t) and its 5alpha-reduced metabolite, dihydrotestosterone (dht), can decrease anxiety-like behavior; however, the mechanisms underlying these effects have not been established. <s1> first, we hypothesized that if t reduces anxiety-like behavior through actions of its 5alpha-reduced metabolite, dht, then gonadectomy (gdx) would increase anxiety-like behavior, an effect which would be reversed by systemic administration of dht. <s2> second, we hypothesized that if t and dht reduce anxiety-like behavior in part through actions at intracellular androgen receptors in the hippocampus, then administration of an androgen receptor antagonist, flutamide, directly to the hippocampus should increase anxiety-like behavior of intact and dht-replaced, but not gdx, male rats. <s3> inserts that were empty or contained flutamide were applied directly to the dorsal hippocampus of intact, gdx, or gdx and dht-replaced rats 2 h prior to testing in the open field, elevated plus maze, or defensive freezing tasks. <s4> gdx rats exhibited significantly more anxiety-like behaviors than intact or dht-replaced rats. <s5> intact and dht-replaced rats administered flutamide to the hippocampus showed significantly more anxiety-like behavior than did intact and dht-replaced controls. <s6> however, flutamide alone did not increase anxiety-like behavior of gdx rats. <s7> together, these findings suggest that androgens can decrease anxiety-like behavior of male rats in part through dht's actions at androgen receptors in the hippocampus.

lp+ss: Chinese individuals with TT homozygosity in the MTHFR gene are less vulnerable to strokes caused by low levels of folate intake. <s0> highly regenerative tissues such as blood must possess effective dna damage responses (ddr) that balance long-term regeneration with protection from leukemogenesis. <s1> hematopoietic stem cells (hscs) sustain life-long blood production, yet their response to dna damage remains largely unexplored. <s2> we report that human hscs exhibit delayed dna double-strand break rejoining, persistent gammah2ax foci, and enhanced p53- and aspp1-dependent apoptosis after gamma-radiation compared to progenitors. <s3> p53 inactivation or bcl-2 overexpression reduced radiation-induced apoptosis and preserved in vivo repopulating hsc function. <s4> despite similar protection from irradiation-induced apoptosis, only bcl-2-overexpressing hscs showed higher self-renewal capacity, establishing that intact p53 positively regulates self-renewal independently from apoptosis. <s5> the reduced self-renewal of hscs with inactivated p53 was associated with increased spontaneous gammah2ax foci in secondary transplants of hscs. <s6> our data reveal distinct physiological roles of p53 that together ensure optimal hsc function: apoptosis regulation and prevention of gammah2ax foci accumulation upon hsc self-renewal.

lp+ss: Chlamydia trachomatis is most prevalent in the UK among sexually-experienced individuals aged 16 to 24. <s0> recombination-dependent dna replication, often called break-induced replication (bir), was initially invoked to explain recombination events in bacteriophage but it has recently been recognized as a fundamentally important mechanism to repair double-strand chromosome breaks in eukaryotes. <s1> this mechanism appears to be critically important in the restarting of stalled and broken replication forks and in maintaining the integrity of eroded telomeres. <s2> although bir helps preserve genome integrity during replication, it also promotes genome instability by the production of loss of heterozygosity and the formation of nonreciprocal translocations, as well as in the generation of complex chromosomal rearrangements. 
lp+ss: Cholesterol loading induces KLF4 expression in VSMCs, resulting in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. <s0> previous studies investigating the role of smooth muscle cells (smcs) and macrophages in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis have provided controversial results owing to the use of unreliable methods for clearly identifying each of these cell types. <s1> here, using myh11-creert2 rosa floxed stop eyfp apoe−/− mice to perform smc lineage tracing, we find that traditional methods for detecting smcs based on immunostaining for smc markers fail to detect >80% of smc-derived cells within advanced atherosclerotic lesions. <s2> these unidentified smc-derived cells exhibit phenotypes of other cell lineages, including macrophages and mesenchymal stem cells (mscs). <s3> smc-specific conditional knockout of krüppel-like factor 4 (klf4) resulted in reduced numbers of smc-derived msc- and macrophage-like cells, a marked reduction in lesion size, and increases in multiple indices of plaque stability, including an increase in fibrous cap thickness as compared to wild-type controls. <s4> on the basis of in vivo klf4 chromatin immunoprecipitation–sequencing (chip-seq) analyses and studies of cholesterol-treated cultured smcs, we identified >800 klf4 target genes, including many that regulate pro-inflammatory responses of smcs. <s5> our findings indicate that the contribution of smcs to atherosclerotic plaques has been greatly underestimated, and that klf4-dependent transitions in smc phenotype are critical in lesion pathogenesis.

lp+ss: Cholesterol loading induces KLF4 expression in VSMCs, resulting in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. <s0> observational clinical and ex vivo studies have established a strong association between atrial fibrillation and inflammation. <s1> however, whether inflammation is the cause or the consequence of atrial fibrillation and which specific inflammatory mediators may increase the atria's susceptibility to fibrillation remain elusive. <s2> here we provide experimental and clinical evidence for the mechanistic involvement of myeloperoxidase (mpo), a heme enzyme abundantly expressed by neutrophils, in the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation. <s3> mpo-deficient mice pretreated with angiotensin ii (angii) to provoke leukocyte activation showed lower atrial tissue abundance of the mpo product 3-chlorotyrosine, reduced activity of matrix metalloproteinases and blunted atrial fibrosis as compared to wild-type mice. <s4> upon right atrial electrophysiological stimulation, mpo-deficient mice were protected from atrial fibrillation, which was reversed when mpo was restored. <s5> humans with atrial fibrillation had higher plasma concentrations of mpo and a larger mpo burden in right atrial tissue as compared to individuals devoid of atrial fibrillation. <s6> in the atria, mpo colocalized with markedly increased formation of 3-chlorotyrosine. <s7> our data demonstrate that mpo is a crucial prerequisite for structural remodeling of the myocardium, leading to an increased vulnerability to atrial fibrillation. 
lp+ss: Cholesterol loading induces KLF4 expression in VSMCs, resulting in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. <s0> background knowledge, attitudes, and risk perception in relation to second primary cancer (spc) screening and their impact on screening practices in cancer survivors are largely unknown.  <s1> methods a total of 326 cancer survivors who had completed primary treatment for cancer >1 year previously were recruited from 6 oncology care outpatient clinics in the republic of korea. <s2> survivors' knowledge, attitudes, perceived risk, and screening practices were assessed along with sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical characteristics. <s3> multivariate logistic regression was used to examine behavioral factors associated with the completion of all appropriate spc screening according to national guidelines.  <s4> results approximately 37.7% of survivors had undergone all appropriate spc screening tests. <s5> survivors were found to have a high perceived risk of spc, high perceived benefits of screening, and positive attitudes toward cancer screening. <s6> however, they had limited knowledge regarding spc screening tests and few had received a recommendation from a physician to undergo spc screening. <s7> although there was no association found between perceived risk and positive attitudes with screening behavior, higher knowledge was noted to be significantly associated with the completion of all appropriate spc screening (adjusted odds ratio, 1.81; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-3.33).  <s8> conclusions in the current study, cancer survivors were found to have limited knowledge regarding second cancer screening tests, which may have resulted in lower rates of completion of screening practices in this population. 
lp+ss: Chronic HIV stimulation of B cells leads to the premature exhaustion of B cells. <s0> the global hiv vaccine enterprise convened a two-day workshop in may of 2007 to discuss humoral immune responses to hiv and approaches to design vaccines that induce viral neutralizing and other potentially protective antibody responses. <s1> the goals of this workshop were to identify key scientific issues, gaps, and opportunities that have emerged since the enterprise strategic plan was first published in 2005 [1], and to make recommendations that enterprise stakeholders can use to plan new activities.  <s2> most effective viral vaccines work, at least in part, by generating antibodies that inactivate or neutralize the invading virus, and the existing data strongly suggest that an optimally effective hiv-1 vaccine should elicit potent antiviral neutralizing antibodies. <s3> however, unlike acute viral pathogens, hiv-1 chronically replicates in the host and evades the antibody response. <s4> this immune evasion, along with the large genetic variation among hiv-1 strains worldwide, has posed major obstacles to vaccine development. <s5> current hiv vaccine candidates do not elicit neutralizing antibodies against most circulating virus strains, and thus the induction of a protective antibody response remains a major priority for hiv-1 vaccine development. <s6> for an antibody-based hiv-1 vaccine, progress in vaccine design is generally gauged by in vitro assays that measure the ability of vaccine-induced antibodies to neutralize a broad spectrum of viral isolates representing the major genetic subtypes (clades) of hiv-1 [2]. <s7> although it is not known what magnitude and breadth of neutralization will predict protection in vaccine recipients, it is clear that current vaccine immunogens elicit antibodies that neutralize only a minority of circulating isolates. <s8> thus, much progress needs to be made in this area. <s9> also, though virus neutralization is considered a critical benchmark for a vaccine, this may not be the only benchmark for predicting success with antibody-based hiv-1 vaccine immunogens.  <s10> the main targets for neutralizing antibodies to hiv-1 are the surface gp120 and trans-membrane gp41 envelope glycoproteins (env) that mediate receptor and coreceptor binding and the subsequent membrane fusion events that allow the virus to gain entry into cells [3]. <s11> antibodies neutralize the virus by binding these viral spikes and blocking virus entry into susceptible cells, such as cd4+ t cells [4,5]. <s12> in order to chronically replicate in the host, the virus exploits several mechanisms to shield itself against antibody recognition, including a dense outer coating of sugar molecules (n-linked glycans) and the strategic positioning of cysteine–cysteine loop structures on the gp120 molecule [6–8]. <s13> these shielding mechanisms, although highly effective, have vulnerabilities imposed by fitness constraints. <s14> information on the precise location and molecular structure of these vulnerable regions could be valuable for the rational design of improved vaccine immunogens.  <s15> participants in the workshop identified four areas that, if given proper attention, could provide key information that would bring the field closer to an effective antibody-based hiv-1 vaccine: (1) structure-assisted immunogen design, (2) role of fc receptors and complement, (3) assay standardization and validation, and (4) immunoregulation of b cell responses. 
lp+ss: Cis-acting lncRNAs control the expression of genes that are positioned in the vicinity of their transcription sites. <s0> antisense transcription is widespread in many genomes; however, how much is functional is hotly debated. <s1> we are investigating functionality of a set of long noncoding antisense transcripts, collectively called coolair, produced at arabidopsis flowering locus c (flc). <s2> coolair initiates just downstream of the major sense transcript poly(a) site and terminates either early or extends into the flc promoter region. <s3> we now show that splicing of coolair is functionally important. <s4> this was revealed through analysis of a hypomorphic mutation in the core spliceosome component prp8. <s5> the prp8 mutation perturbs a cotranscriptional feedback mechanism linking coolair processing to flc gene body histone demethylation and reduced flc transcription. <s6> the importance of coolair splicing in this repression mechanism was confirmed by disrupting coolair production and mutating the coolair proximal splice acceptor site. <s7> our findings suggest that altered splicing of a long noncoding transcript can quantitatively modulate gene expression through cotranscriptional coupling mechanisms. 
lp+ss: Citrullinated proteins externalized in neutrophil extracellular traps act indirectly to disrupt the inflammatory cycle. <s0> the early events leading to the development of rheumatoid arthritis (ra) remain unclear, but formation of autoantibodies to citrullinated protein antigens (acpas) is considered a key pathogenic event. <s1> neutrophils isolated from patients with various autoimmune diseases display enhanced neutrophil extracellular trap (net) formation, a phenomenon that exposes autoantigens in the context of immunostimulatory molecules. <s2> we investigated whether aberrant netosis occurs in ra, determined its triggers, and examined its deleterious inflammatory consequences. <s3> enhanced netosis was observed in circulating and ra synovial fluid neutrophils compared to neutrophils from healthy controls and from patients with osteoarthritis (oa). <s4> further, netting neutrophils infiltrated ra synovial tissue, rheumatoid nodules, and skin. <s5> netosis correlated with acpa presence and levels and with systemic inflammatory markers. <s6> ra sera and immunoglobulin fractions from ra patients with high levels of acpa and/or rheumatoid factor significantly enhanced netosis, and the nets induced by these autoantibodies displayed distinct protein content. <s7> indeed, during netosis, neutrophils externalized the citrullinated autoantigens implicated in ra pathogenesis, and anti-citrullinated vimentin antibodies potently induced net formation. <s8> moreover, the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-17a (il-17a) and tumor necrosis factor-α (tnf-α) induced netosis in ra neutrophils. <s9> in turn, nets significantly augmented inflammatory responses in ra and oa synovial fibroblasts, including induction of il-6, il-8, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. <s10> these observations implicate accelerated netosis in ra pathogenesis, through externalization of citrullinated autoantigens and immunostimulatory molecules that may promote aberrant adaptive and innate immune responses in the joint and in the periphery, and perpetuate pathogenic mechanisms in this disease.

lp+ss: Cognitive behavioral therapy is an ineffective treatment for insomnia <s0> circadian rhythm sleep disorders are characterized by complaints of insomnia and excessive sleepiness that are primarily due to alterations in the internal circadian timing system or a misalignment between the timing of sleep and the 24-h social and physical environment. <s1> in addition to physiological and environmental factors, maladaptive behaviors often play an important role in the development of many of the circadian rhythm sleep disorders. <s2> this review will focus on the clinical approach to the diagnosis and management of the various circadian rhythm sleep disorders, including delayed sleep phase disorder, advanced sleep phase disorder, non-entrained type, irregular sleep-wake rhythm, shift work sleep disorder and jet lag disorder. <s3> diagnostic tools such as sleep diaries and wrist activity monitoring are often useful in confirming the diagnosis. <s4> because behavioral and environmental factors often are involved in the development of these conditions, a multimodal approach is usually necessary. <s5> interventions include sleep hygiene education, timed exposure to bright light as well as avoidance of bright light at the wrong time of the day and pharmacologic approaches, such as melatonin. <s6> however, it should be noted that the use of melatonin is not an fda-approved indication for the treatment of circadian rhythm sleep disorders.

lp+ss: Combination nicotine replacement therapies with varenicline or bupropion are more effective after 12 weeks of reatment compared to varenicline monotherapy. <s0> recent experimental studies and theoretical models have begun to address the challenge of establishing a causal link between subjective conscious experience and measurable neuronal activity. <s1> the present review focuses on the well-delimited issue of how an external or internal piece of information goes beyond nonconscious processing and gains access to conscious processing, a transition characterized by the existence of a reportable subjective experience. <s2> converging neuroimaging and neurophysiological data, acquired during minimal experimental contrasts between conscious and nonconscious processing, point to objective neural measures of conscious access: late amplification of relevant sensory activity, long-distance cortico-cortical synchronization at beta and gamma frequencies, and "ignition" of a large-scale prefronto-parietal network. <s3> we compare these findings to current theoretical models of conscious processing, including the global neuronal workspace (gnw) model according to which conscious access occurs when incoming information is made globally available to multiple brain systems through a network of neurons with long-range axons densely distributed in prefrontal, parieto-temporal, and cingulate cortices. <s4> the clinical implications of these results for general anesthesia, coma, vegetative state, and schizophrenia are discussed.

lp+ss: Continued HHV-8 transmission among MSM in San Francisco may be explained by urogenital contact. <s0> background and purpose the par(2) receptors are involved in chronic arthritis by mechanisms that are as yet unclear. <s1> here, we examined par(2) activation in the rat knee joint.    <s2> experimental approach par(2) in rat knee joint dorsal root ganglia (drg) cells at l3-l5, retrogradely labelled with fluoro-gold (fg) were demonstrated immunohistochemically. <s3> electrophysiological recordings from knee joint nerve fibres in urethane anaesthetized wistar rats assessed the effects of stimulating joint par(2) with its activating peptide, 2-furoyl-ligrlo-nh(2) (1-100 nmol·100 μl(-1) , via close intra-arterial injection). <s4> fibre firing rate was recorded during joint rotations before and 15 min after administration of par(2) activating peptide or control peptide. <s5> leukocyte kinetics in the synovial vasculature upon par(2) activation were followed by intravital microscopy for 60 min after perfusion of 2-furoyl-ligrlo-nh(2) or control peptide. <s6> roles for transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (trpv1) or neurokinin-1 (nk(1) ) receptors in the par(2) responses were assessed using the selective antagonists, sb366791 and rp67580 respectively.    <s7> key results par(2) were expressed in 59 ± 5% of fg-positive drg cells; 100 nmol 2-furoyl-ligrlo-nh(2) increased joint fibre firing rate during normal and noxious rotation, maximal at 3 min (normal; 110 ± 43%, noxious; 90 ± 31%). <s8> 2-furoyl-ligrlo-nh(2) also significantly increased leukocyte rolling and adhesion over 60 min. <s9> all these effects were blocked by pre-treatment with sb366791 and rp67580 (p < 0.05 compared with 2-furoyl-ligrlo-nh(2) alone).  <s10> conclusions and implications par(2) receptors play an acute inflammatory role in the knee joint via trpv1- and nk(1) -dependent mechanisms involving both par(2) -mediated neuronal sensitization and leukocyte trafficking.

lp+ss: Converting apoE4 to apoE3 by gene editing worsens the pathology associated with apoE4 in human iPSCderived neurons. <s0> selective control of receptor trafficking provides a mechanism for remodeling the receptor composition of excitatory synapses, and thus supports synaptic transmission, plasticity, and development. <s1> glun3a (formerly nr3a) is a nonconventional member of the nmda receptor (nmdar) subunit family, which endows nmdar channels with low calcium permeability and reduced magnesium sensitivity compared with nmdars comprising only glun1 and glun2 subunits. <s2> because of these special properties, glun3a subunits act as a molecular brake to limit the plasticity and maturation of excitatory synapses, pointing toward glun3a removal as a critical step in the development of neuronal circuitry. <s3> however, the molecular signals mediating glun3a endocytic removal remain unclear. <s4> here we define a novel endocytic motif (ywl), which is located within the cytoplasmic c-terminal tail of glun3a and mediates its binding to the clathrin adaptor ap2. <s5> alanine mutations within the glun3a endocytic motif inhibited clathrin-dependent internalization and led to accumulation of glun3a-containing nmdars at the cell surface, whereas mimicking phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue promoted internalization and reduced cell-surface expression as shown by immunocytochemical and electrophysiological approaches in recombinant systems and rat neurons in primary culture. <s6> we further demonstrate that the tyrosine residue is phosphorylated by src family kinases, and that src-activation limits surface glun3a expression in neurons. <s7> together, our results identify a new molecular signal for glun3a internalization that couples the functional surface expression of glun3a-containing receptors to the phosphorylation state of glun3a subunits, and provides a molecular framework for the regulation of nmdar subunit composition with implications for synaptic plasticity and neurodevelopment.

lp+ss: Cost effectiveness evaluations based on cRCT data accurately reflect prices for patients in actual clinical practice. <s0> background emergency postcoital contraception prevents pregnancy, but it must be prescribed by a doctor and taken within 72 hours of intercourse. <s1> it has been proposed that emergency contraception be made available without a prescription. <s2> we undertook a study to learn how women might behave if given a supply of emergency contraceptive pills to keep at home.  <s3> methods we assigned 553 women to be given a replaceable supply of hormonal emergency contraceptive pills to take home (the treatment group) and 530 women to use emergency contraception obtained by visiting a doctor (the control group). <s4> the frequency of use of emergency contraception, the use of other contraceptives, and the incidence of unwanted pregnancy were determined in both groups of women one year later.  <s5> results the results for 549 women in the treatment group and 522 women in the control group were available for analysis. <s6> three hundred seventy-nine of the women in the treatment group (69 percent) and 326 of the women in the control group (62 percent) contributed detailed information at follow-up. <s7> one hundred eighty of the women in the treatment group (47 percent) used emergency contraception at least once. <s8> among those who returned the study questionnaire, 98 percent used emergency contraception correctly. <s9> there were no serious adverse effects. <s10> eighty-seven women in the control group (27 percent) used emergency contraception at least once (p<0.001 for the comparison with the treatment group). <s11> the women in the treatment group were not more likely to use emergency contraception repeatedly. <s12> their use of other methods of contraception was no different from that of the women in the control group. <s13> there were 18 unintended pregnancies in the treatment group and 25 in the control group (relative risk, 0.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.4 to 1.2).  <s14> conclusions making emergency contraception more easily obtainable does no harm and may reduce the rate of unwanted pregnancies.

lp+ss: Cost effectiveness evaluations based on cRCT data lack external validity. <s0> myelin regeneration can occur spontaneously in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (ms). <s1> however, the underlying mechanisms and causes of its frequent failure remain incompletely understood. <s2> here we show, using an in-vivo remyelination model, that demyelinated axons are electrically active and generate de novo synapses with recruited oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (opcs), which, early after lesion induction, sense neuronal activity by expressing ampa (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid)/kainate receptors. <s3> blocking neuronal activity, axonal vesicular release or ampa receptors in demyelinated lesions results in reduced remyelination. <s4> in the absence of neuronal activity there is a ∼6-fold increase in opc number within the lesions and a reduced proportion of differentiated oligodendrocytes. <s5> these findings reveal that neuronal activity and release of glutamate instruct opcs to differentiate into new myelinating oligodendrocytes that recover lost function. <s6> co-localization of opcs with the presynaptic protein vglut2 in ms lesions implies that this mechanism may provide novel targets to therapeutically enhance remyelination. 
lp+ss: Crossover hot spots are found within gene promoters in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. <s0> dna double-strand breaks (dsbs), which are formed by the spo11 protein, initiate meiotic recombination. <s1> previous dsb-mapping studies have used rad50s or sae2δ mutants, which are defective in break processing, to accumulate spo11-linked dsbs, and report large (≥ 50 kb) "dsb-hot" regions that are separated by "dsb-cold" domains of similar size. <s2> substantial recombination occurs in some dsb-cold regions, suggesting that dsb patterns are not normal in rad50s or sae2δ mutants. <s3> we therefore developed a novel method to map genome-wide, single-strand dna (ssdna)–associated dsbs that accumulate in processing-capable, repair-defective dmc1δ and dmc1δ rad51δ mutants. <s4> dsbs were observed at known hot spots, but also in most previously identified "dsb-cold" regions, including near centromeres and telomeres. <s5> although approximately 40% of the genome is dsb-cold in rad50s mutants, analysis of meiotic ssdna from dmc1δ shows that most of these regions have substantial dsb activity. <s6> southern blot assays of dsbs in selected regions in dmc1δ, rad50s, and wild-type cells confirm these findings. <s7> thus, dsbs are distributed much more uniformly than was previously believed. <s8> comparisons of dsb signals in dmc1, dmc1 rad51, and dmc1 spo11 mutant strains identify dmc1 as a critical strand-exchange activity genome-wide, and confirm previous conclusions that spo11-induced lesions initiate all meiotic recombination. 
lp+ss: Cyclin A2 destruction is necessary to switch from unstable to stable kt-mt attachments in mitosis. <s0> the most conspicuous event in the cell cycle is the alignment of chromosomes in metaphase. <s1> chromosome alignment fosters faithful segregation through the formation of bi-oriented attachments of kinetochores to spindle microtubules. <s2> notably, numerous kinetochore-microtubule (k-mt) attachment errors are present in early mitosis (prometaphase), and the persistence of those errors is the leading cause of chromosome mis-segregation in aneuploid human tumour cells that continually mis-segregate whole chromosomes and display chromosomal instability. <s3> how robust error correction is achieved in prometaphase to ensure error-free mitosis remains unknown. <s4> here we show that k-mt attachments in prometaphase cells are considerably less stable than in metaphase cells. <s5> the switch to more stable k-mt attachments in metaphase requires the proteasome-dependent destruction of cyclin a in prometaphase. <s6> persistent cyclin a expression prevents k-mt stabilization even in cells with aligned chromosomes. <s7> by contrast, k-mts are prematurely stabilized in cyclin-a-deficient cells. <s8> consequently, cells lacking cyclin a display higher rates of chromosome mis-segregation. <s9> thus, the stability of k-mt attachments increases decisively in a coordinated fashion among all chromosomes as cells transit from prometaphase to metaphase. <s10> cyclin a creates a cellular environment that promotes microtubule detachment from kinetochores in prometaphase to ensure efficient error correction and faithful chromosome segregation.

lp+ss: DUSP4 decreases apoptosis. <s0> most protein complexes are inaccessible to high resolution structural analysis. <s1> we report the results of a combined approach of cross-linking, mass spectrometry, and bioinformatics to two human complexes containing large coiled-coil segments, the ndel1 homodimer and the ndc80 heterotetramer. <s2> an important limitation of the cross-linking approach, so far, was the identification of cross-linked peptides from fragmentation spectra. <s3> our novel approach overcomes the data analysis bottleneck of cross-linking and mass spectrometry. <s4> we constructed a purpose-built database to match spectra with cross-linked peptides, define a score that expresses the quality of our identification, and estimate false positive rates. <s5> we show that our analysis sheds light on critical structural parameters such as the directionality of the homodimeric coiled coil of ndel1, the register of the heterodimeric coiled coils of the ndc80 complex, and the organization of a tetramerization region in the ndc80 complex. <s6> our approach is especially useful to address complexes that are difficult in addressing by standard structural methods. 
lp+ss: DUSP4 decreases apoptosis. <s0> exposure to psychosocial stress is a risk factor for many diseases, including atherosclerosis. <s1> although incompletely understood, interaction between the psyche and the immune system provides one potential mechanism linking stress and disease inception and progression. <s2> known cross-talk between the brain and immune system includes the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which centrally drives glucocorticoid production in the adrenal cortex, and the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axis, which controls stress-induced catecholamine release in support of the fight-or-flight reflex. <s3> it remains unknown, however, whether chronic stress changes hematopoietic stem cell activity. <s4> here we show that stress increases proliferation of these most primitive hematopoietic progenitors, giving rise to higher levels of disease-promoting inflammatory leukocytes. <s5> we found that chronic stress induced monocytosis and neutrophilia in humans. <s6> while investigating the source of leukocytosis in mice, we discovered that stress activates upstream hematopoietic stem cells. <s7> under conditions of chronic variable stress in mice, sympathetic nerve fibers released surplus noradrenaline, which signaled bone marrow niche cells to decrease cxcl12 levels through the β3-adrenergic receptor. <s8> consequently, hematopoietic stem cell proliferation was elevated, leading to an increased output of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes. <s9> when atherosclerosis-prone apoe(-/-) mice were subjected to chronic stress, accelerated hematopoiesis promoted plaque features associated with vulnerable lesions that cause myocardial infarction and stroke in humans.

lp+ss: De novo assembly of sequence data has fewer specific contigs than unassembled sequence data. <s0> in mammals, the canonical nuclear factor κb (nf-κb) signaling pathway activated in response to infections is based on degradation of iκb inhibitors. <s1> this pathway depends on the iκb kinase (ikk), which contains two catalytic subunits, ikkα and ikkβ. <s2> ikkβ is essential for inducible iκb phosphorylation and degradation, whereas ikkα is not. <s3> here we show that ikkα is required for b cell maturation, formation of secondary lymphoid organs, increased expression of certain nf-κb target genes, and processing of the nf-κb2 (p100) precursor. <s4> ikkα preferentially phosphorylates nf-κb2, and this activity requires its phosphorylation by upstream kinases, one of which may be nf-κb–inducing kinase (nik). <s5> ikkα is therefore a pivotal component of a second nf-κb activation pathway based on regulated nf-κb2 processing rather than iκb degradation. 
lp+ss: De novo assembly of sequence data has shorter contigs than unassembled sequence data. <s0> importance identification of the bacterium responsible for an outbreak can aid in disease management. <s1> however, traditional culture-based diagnosis can be difficult, particularly if no specific diagnostic test is available for an outbreak strain.  <s2> objective to explore the potential of metagenomics, which is the direct sequencing of dna extracted from microbiologically complex samples, as an open-ended clinical discovery platform capable of identifying and characterizing bacterial strains from an outbreak without laboratory culture.  <s3> design, setting, and patients in a retrospective investigation, 45 samples were selected from fecal specimens obtained from patients with diarrhea during the 2011 outbreak of shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli (stec) o104:h4 in germany. <s4> samples were subjected to high-throughput sequencing (august-september 2012), followed by a 3-phase analysis (november 2012-february 2013). <s5> in phase 1, a de novo assembly approach was developed to obtain a draft genome of the outbreak strain. <s6> in phase 2, the depth of coverage of the outbreak strain genome was determined in each sample. <s7> in phase 3, sequences from each sample were compared with sequences from known bacteria to identify pathogens other than the outbreak strain.  <s8> main outcomes and measures the recovery of genome sequence data for the purposes of identification and characterization of the outbreak strain and other pathogens from fecal samples.  <s9> results during phase 1, a draft genome of the stec outbreak strain was obtained. <s10> during phase 2, the outbreak strain genome was recovered from 10 samples at greater than 10-fold coverage and from 26 samples at greater than 1-fold coverage. <s11> sequences from the shiga-toxin genes were detected in 27 of 40 stec-positive samples (67%). <s12> in phase 3, sequences from clostridium difficile, campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter concisus, and salmonella enterica were recovered.  <s13> conclusions and relevance these results suggest the potential of metagenomics as a culture-independent approach for the identification of bacterial pathogens during an outbreak of diarrheal disease. <s14> challenges include improving diagnostic sensitivity, speeding up and simplifying workflows, and reducing costs. 
lp+ss: Decreased conversion of PGE 2 to PPARy ligand 15-ket-PGE 2 causes accumulation of PGE. <s0> studies of replication timing provide a handle into previously impenetrable higher-order levels of chromosome organization and their plasticity during development. <s1> although mechanisms regulating replication timing are not clear, novel genome-wide studies provide a thorough survey of the extent to which replication timing is regulated during most of the early cell fate transitions in mammals, revealing coordinated changes of a defined set of 400–800 kb chromosomal segments that involve at least half the genome. <s2> furthermore, changes in replication time are linked to changes in sub-nuclear organization and domain-wide transcriptional potential, and tissue-specific replication timing profiles are conserved from mouse to human, suggesting that the program has developmental significance. <s3> hence, these studies have provided a solid foundation for linking megabase level chromosome structure to function, and suggest a central role for replication in domain-level genome organization.

lp+ss: Deleting Raptor increases G-CSF levels. <s0> synchronous oscillations of thousands of cellular clocks in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (scn), the circadian centre, are coordinated by precisely timed cell-cell communication, the principle of which is largely unknown. <s1> here we show that the amount of rgs16 (regulator of g protein signalling 16), a protein known to inactivate gαi, increases at a selective circadian time to allow time-dependent activation of intracellular cyclic amp signalling in the scn. <s2> gene ablation of rgs16 leads to the loss of circadian production of camp and as a result lengthens circadian period of behavioural rhythm. <s3> the temporally precise regulation of the camp signal by clock-controlled rgs16 is needed for the dorsomedial scn to maintain a normal phase-relationship to the ventrolateral scn. <s4> thus, rgs16-dependent temporal regulation of intracellular g protein signalling coordinates the intercellular synchrony of scn pacemaker neurons and thereby defines the 24 h rhythm in behaviour. 
lp+ss: Deleting Raptor increases G-CSF levels. <s0> to efficiently counteract pathogens, plants rely on a complex set of immune responses that are tightly regulated to allow the timely activation, appropriate duration and adequate amplitude of defense programs. <s1> the coordination of the plant immune response is known to require the activity of the ubiquitin/proteasome system, which controls the stability of proteins in eukaryotes. <s2> here, we demonstrate that the n-end rule pathway, a subset of the ubiquitin/proteasome system, regulates the defense against a wide range of bacterial and fungal pathogens in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana. <s3> we show that this pathway positively regulates the biosynthesis of plant-defense metabolites such as glucosinolates, as well as the biosynthesis and response to the phytohormone jasmonic acid, which plays a key role in plant immunity. <s4> our results also suggest that the arginylation branch of the n-end rule pathway regulates the timing and amplitude of the defense program against the model pathogen pseudomonas syringae avrrpm1. 
lp+ss: Deletion of ATM and Rad3 related protein is not predictive of acute tissue loss. <s0> face-to-face surveys of policy-makers and other influential leaders are a useful tool to identify, at an early stage, (a) major issues regarding the introduction of a new vaccine, (b) persons and groups in a country who play a major decision-making or influential role in the introduction of vaccines, (c) potential obstacles to the introduction of vaccines, and (d) data-needs of policy-makers to overcome these obstacles. <s1> by surveying the opinions and beliefs of those who will make or influence decisions on whether to introduce a new vaccine, these studies can help ensure that research activities respond to the needs of policy-makers in countries endemic for the target diseases. <s2> these surveys can also inform vaccine-introduction strategies by identifying financially and politically feasible means of distributing, targeting, and financing the vaccines. <s3> this paper describes the methodology used in conducting such surveys and discusses methodological issues. <s4> it also presents lessons learnt from two policy-maker surveys carried out in several asian countries in regard to new-generation vaccines against cholera, typhoid fever, and shigellosis; and future vaccines against dengue fever/dengue haemorrhagic fever. 
lp+ss: Deletion of ATM and Rad3 related protein leads to acute tissue loss. <s0> macrophages produce a large amount of pge(2) during inflammation. <s1> this lipid mediator modulates various immune responses. <s2> pge(2) acts on macrophages and inhibits production of cytokines such as tnf-alpha and il-12. <s3> membrane-bound glutathione-dependent pge(2) synthase (mpges) has been shown to be a terminal enzyme of the cyclooxygenase-2-mediated pge(2) biosynthesis. <s4> here we identified mpges as a molecule that is induced by lps in macrophages. <s5> the expression of mpges was not induced by lps in mice lacking toll-like receptor 4 or myd88. <s6> furthermore, mice deficient in nf-il6 showed neither induction of mpges nor biosynthesis of pge(2) in response to lps, indicating that mpges expression in response to lps is regulated by a toll-like receptor 4/myd88/nf-il6-dependent signaling pathway. <s7> we generated mpges-deficient mice and investigated the role of mpges in vivo. <s8> the mice showed no augmentation of the pge(2) production in response to lps. <s9> however, they were not impaired in the lps-induced production of inflammatory cytokines and showed normal response to the lps-induced shock. <s10> thus, mpges is critically involved in the biosynthesis of pge(2) induced by lps, but is dispensable for the modulation of inflammatory responses.

lp+ss: Deltex has no known interactions with eIF3f. <s0> age-related degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (bfcns) occurs early and contributes significantly to cognitive decline in alzheimer's disease (ad). <s1> proper function and morphology of bfcns depends on the supply of nerve growth factor (ngf) from the cortex and the hippocampus. <s2> a large number of experiments have shown that decreased supply of ngf at the level of bfcn cell bodies leads to loss of neuronal markers and shrinkage, mimicking what is observed in ad. <s3> the delivery of sufficient amounts of ngf signal to bfcn cell bodies depends on the effective participation of several factors including sufficient synthesis and release of ngf, adequate synthesis and expression of ngf receptors by bfcns, normal signaling and retrograde transport of ngf-receptor complex, and finally effective induction of gene expression by ngf. <s4> in the past few years it has become clear that decreased amounts of ngf at the level of bfcn cell bodies is largely due to failed retrograde transport rather than decreased synthesis, binding or expression of ngf receptors in the bfcn terminals. <s5> we will discuss in vivo evidence supporting decreased retrograde transport of ngf in a mouse model with bfcn degeneration, and will attempt to match these findings with our studies in postmortem human ad brain. <s6> we will speculate about the possible mechanisms of failed ngf retrograde transport and its relationship to ad pathology.

lp+ss: Deregulation of HAND2 is a crucial step in endometrial carcinogenesis in mice. <s0> background endometrial cancer incidence is continuing to rise in the wake of the current ageing and obesity epidemics. <s1> much of the risk for endometrial cancer development is influenced by the environment and lifestyle. <s2> accumulating evidence suggests that the epigenome serves as the interface between the genome and the environment and that hypermethylation of stem cell polycomb group target genes is an epigenetic hallmark of cancer. <s3> the objective of this study was to determine the functional role of epigenetic factors in endometrial cancer development.  <s4> methods and findings epigenome-wide methylation analysis of >27,000 cpg sites in endometrial cancer tissue samples (n = 64) and control samples (n = 23) revealed that hand2 (a gene encoding a transcription factor expressed in the endometrial stroma) is one of the most commonly hypermethylated and silenced genes in endometrial cancer. <s5> a novel integrative epigenome-transcriptome-interactome analysis further revealed that hand2 is the hub of the most highly ranked differential methylation hotspot in endometrial cancer. <s6> these findings were validated using candidate gene methylation analysis in multiple clinical sample sets of tissue samples from a total of 272 additional women. <s7> increased hand2 methylation was a feature of premalignant endometrial lesions and was seen to parallel a decrease in rna and protein levels. <s8> furthermore, women with high endometrial hand2 methylation in their premalignant lesions were less likely to respond to progesterone treatment. <s9> hand2 methylation analysis of endometrial secretions collected using high vaginal swabs taken from women with postmenopausal bleeding specifically identified those patients with early stage endometrial cancer with both high sensitivity and high specificity (receiver operating characteristics area under the curve = 0.91 for stage 1a and 0.97 for higher than stage 1a). <s10> finally, mice harbouring a hand2 knock-out specifically in their endometrium were shown to develop precancerous endometrial lesions with increasing age, and these lesions also demonstrated a lack of pten expression.  <s11> conclusions hand2 methylation is a common and crucial molecular alteration in endometrial cancer that could potentially be employed as a biomarker for early detection of endometrial cancer and as a predictor of treatment response. <s12> the true clinical utility of hand2 dna methylation, however, requires further validation in prospective studies. <s13> please see later in the article for the editors' summary.

lp+ss: Deregulation of HAND2 is a crucial step in endometrial carcinogenesis in mice. <s0> sr proteins are well-characterized rna binding proteins that promote exon inclusion by binding to exonic splicing enhancers (eses). <s1> however, it has been unclear whether regulatory rules deduced on model genes apply generally to activities of sr proteins in the cell. <s2> here, we report global analyses of two prototypical sr proteins, srsf1 (sf2/asf) and srsf2 (sc35), using splicing-sensitive arrays and clip-seq on mouse embryo fibroblasts (mefs). <s3> unexpectedly, we find that these sr proteins promote both inclusion and skipping of exons in vivo, but their binding patterns do not explain such opposite responses. <s4> further analyses reveal that loss of one sr protein is accompanied by coordinated loss or compensatory gain in the interaction of other sr proteins at the affected exons. <s5> therefore, specific effects on regulated splicing by one sr protein actually depend on a complex set of relationships with multiple other sr proteins in mammalian genomes. 
lp+ss: Destination container port throughput(CPT) is negatively related to dengue virus (DENV-1) diffusion in air traffic shipments. <s0> background aedes aegypti, the major vector of dengue viruses, often breeds in water storage containers used by households without tap water supply, and occurs in high numbers even in dense urban areas. <s1> we analysed the interaction between human population density and lack of tap water as a cause of dengue fever outbreaks with the aim of identifying geographic areas at highest risk.  <s2> methods and findings we conducted an individual-level cohort study in a population of 75,000 geo-referenced households in vietnam over the course of two epidemics, on the basis of dengue hospital admissions (n = 3,013). <s3> we applied space-time scan statistics and mathematical models to confirm the findings. <s4> we identified a surprisingly narrow range of critical human population densities between around 3,000 to 7,000 people/km² prone to dengue outbreaks. <s5> in the study area, this population density was typical of villages and some peri-urban areas. <s6> scan statistics showed that areas with a high population density or adequate water supply did not experience severe outbreaks. <s7> the risk of dengue was higher in rural than in urban areas, largely explained by lack of piped water supply, and in human population densities more often falling within the critical range. <s8> mathematical modeling suggests that simple assumptions regarding area-level vector/host ratios may explain the occurrence of outbreaks.  <s9> conclusions rural areas may contribute at least as much to the dissemination of dengue fever as cities. <s10> improving water supply and vector control in areas with a human population density critical for dengue transmission could increase the efficiency of control efforts. <s11> please see later in the article for the editors' summary. 
lp+ss: Destination container port throughput(CPT) is negatively related to dengue virus (DENV-1) diffusion in air traffic shipments. <s0> embryonic stem (es) cell-derived clones and chimeras are often associated with growth abnormalities during fetal development, leading to the production of over/under-weight offspring that show elevated neonatal mortality and morbidity. <s1> due to the role played by imprinted genes in controlling fetal growth, much of the blame is pointed at improper epigenetic reprogramming of cells used in the procedures. <s2> we have analyzed the expression pattern of two growth regulatory imprinted genes, namely insulin like growth factor ii (igf2) and h19, in mouse es cells cultured under growth restricted conditions and after in vitro aging. <s3> culture of cells with serum-depleted media (starvation) and at high cell density (confluence) increased the expression of both imprinted genes and led to aberrant methylation profiles of differentially methylated regions in key regulatory sites of igf2 and h19. <s4> these findings confirm that growth constrained cultures of es cells are associated with alterations to methylation of the regulatory domains and the expression patterns of imprinted genes, suggesting a possible role of epigenetic factors in the loss of developmental potential. 
lp+ss: Destination container port throughput(CPT) is positively related to dengue virus (DENV-1) diffusion in air traffic shipments. <s0> background jx-594 is a targeted oncolytic poxvirus designed to selectively replicate in and destroy cancer cells with cell-cycle abnormalities and epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr)-ras pathway activation. <s1> direct oncolysis plus granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf) expression also stimulates shutdown of tumour vasculature and antitumoral immunity. <s2> we aimed to assess intratumoral injection of jx-594 in patients with refractory primary or metastatic liver cancer.  <s3> methods between jan 4, 2006, and july 4, 2007, 14 patients with histologically confirmed refractory primary or metastatic liver tumours (up to 10.9 cm total diameter) that were amenable to image-guided intratumoral injections were enrolled into this non-comparative, open-label, phase i dose-escalation trial (standard 3x3 design; two to six patients for each dose with 12-18 estimated total patients). <s4> patients received one of four doses of intratumoral jx-594 (10(8) plaque-forming units [pfu], 3x10(8) pfu, 10(9) pfu, or 3x10(9) pfu) every 3 weeks at dong-a university hospital (busan, south korea). <s5> patients were monitored after treatment for at least 48 h in hospital and for at least 4 weeks as out-patients. <s6> adverse event-monitoring according to the national cancer institute common toxicity criteria (version 3) and standard laboratory toxicity grading for haematology, liver and renal function, coagulation studies, serum chemistry, and urinalysis were done. <s7> the primary aims were to ascertain the maximum-tolerated dose (mtd) and safety of jx-594 treatment. <s8> data were also collected on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy. <s9> analysis was per protocol. <s10> this study is registered with clinicaltrials.gov, number nct00629759.  <s11> findings of 22 patients with liver tumours who were assessed for eligibility, eight patients did not meet inclusion criteria. <s12> therefore, 14 patients, including those with hepatocellular, colorectal, melanoma, and lung cancer, were enrolled. <s13> patients were heavily pretreated (5.6 previous treatments, sd 2.8, range 2.0-12.0) and had large tumours (7.0 cm diameter, sd 2.7, range 1.8-10.9). <s14> patients received a mean of 3.4 (sd 2.2, range 1.0-8.0) cycles of jx-594. <s15> all patients were evaluable for toxicity. <s16> all patients experienced grade i-iii flu-like symptoms, and four had transient grade i-iii dose-related thrombocytopenia. <s17> grade iii hyperbilirubinaemia was dose-limiting in both patients at the highest dose; the mtd was therefore 1x10(9) pfu. <s18> jx-594 replication-dependent dissemination in blood was shown, with resultant infection of non-injected tumour sites. <s19> gm-csf expression resulted in grade i-iii increases in neutrophil counts in four of six patients at the mtd. <s20> tumour responses were shown in injected and non-injected tumours. <s21> ten patients were radiographically evaluable for objective responses; non-evaluable patients had contraindications to contrast medium (n=2) or no post-treatment scans (n=2). <s22> according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (recist), three patients had partial response, six had stable disease, and one had progressive disease.  <s23> interpretation intratumoral injection of jx-594 into primary or metastatic liver tumours was generally well-tolerated. <s24> direct hyperbilirubinaemia was the dose-limiting toxicity. <s25> safety was acceptable in the context of jx-594 replication, gm-csf expression, systemic dissemination, and jx-594 had anti-tumoral effects against several refractory carcinomas. <s26> phase ii trials are now underway.

lp+ss: Dscam1 acts as a hypervariable pattern-recognition receptor for the immune system. <s0> genome-wide copy number profiles were characterized in 41 primary bladder tumors using array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array cgh). <s1> in addition to previously identified alterations in large chromosomal regions, alterations were identified in many small genomic regions, some with high-level amplifications or homozygous deletions. <s2> high-level amplifications were detected for 192 genomic clones, most frequently at 6p22.3 (e2f3), 8p12 (fgfr1), 8q22.2 (cmyc), 11q13 (ccnd1, ems1, int2), and 19q13.1 (ccne). <s3> homozygous deletions were detected in 51 genomic clones, with four showing deletions in more than one case: two clones mapping to 9p21.3 (cdkn2a/p16, in nine cases), one at 8p23.1 (three cases), and one at 11p13 (two cases). <s4> significant correlations were observed between copy number gain of clones containing ccne1 and gain of erbb2, and between gain of ccnd1 and deletion of tp53. <s5> in addition, there was a significant complementary association between gain of ccnd1 and gain of e2f3. <s6> although there was no significant relationship between copy number changes and tumor stage or grade, the linked behavior among genomic loci suggests that array cgh will be increasingly important in understanding pathways critical to bladder tumor biology. 
lp+ss: Dscam1 acts as a hypervariable pattern-recognition receptor for the immune system. <s0> in many eukaryotes, rna-dependent rna polymerases (rdrps) play key roles in the rnai pathway. <s1> they have been implicated in the recognition and processing of aberrant transcripts triggering the process, and in amplification of the silencing response. <s2> we have tested the functions of rdrp genes from the ciliate paramecium tetraurelia in experimentally induced and endogenous mechanisms of gene silencing. <s3> in this organism, rnai can be triggered either by high-copy, truncated transgenes or by directly feeding cells with double-stranded rna (dsrna). <s4> surprisingly, dsrna-induced silencing depends on the putatively functional rdr1 and rdr2 genes, which are required for the accumulation of both primary sirnas and a distinct class of small rnas suggestive of secondary sirnas. <s5> in contrast, a third gene with a highly divergent catalytic domain, rdr3, is required for sirna accumulation when rnai is triggered by truncated transgenes. <s6> our data further implicate rdr3 in the accumulation of previously described endogenous sirnas and in the regulation of the surface antigen gene family. <s7> while only one of these genes is normally expressed in any clonal cell line, the knockdown of rdr3 leads to co-expression of multiple antigens. <s8> these results provide evidence for a functional specialization of paramecium rdrp genes in distinct rnai pathways operating during vegetative growth. 
lp+ss: During non-homologous end joining, the ligation step is not as tolerant of disrepairs and other distortions when joining 3' of strand breaks as compared to 5' strand breaks. <s0> nonhomologous end joining (nhej) can effectively resolve chromosome breaks despite diverse end structures; however, it is unclear how the steps employed for resolution are determined. <s1> we sought to address this question by analysing cellular nhej of ends with systematically mispaired and damaged termini. <s2> we show nhej is uniquely proficient at bypassing subtle terminal mispairs and radiomimetic damage by direct ligation. <s3> nevertheless, bypass ability varies widely, with increases in mispair severity gradually reducing bypass products from 85 to 6%. <s4> end-processing by nucleases and polymerases is increased to compensate, although paths with the fewest number of steps to generate a substrate suitable for ligation are favoured. <s5> thus, both the frequency and nature of end processing are tailored to meet the needs of the ligation step. <s6> we propose a model where the ligase organizes all steps during nhej within the stable paired-end complex to limit end processing and associated errors. 
lp+ss: During the primary early antibody response activated B cells migrate toward the inner-and outer follicular areas where oxysterol accumulation is generated by stromal cells. <s0> the ndc80 complex is the key microtubule-binding element of the kinetochore. <s1> in contrast to the well-characterized interaction of ndc80-nuf2 heads with microtubules, little is known about how the spc24-25 heterodimer connects to centromeric chromatin. <s2> here, we present molecular details of spc24-25 in complex with the histone-fold protein cnn1/cenp-t illustrating how this connection ultimately links microtubules to chromosomes. <s3> the conserved ndc80 receptor motif of cnn1 is bound as an α helix in a hydrophobic cleft at the interface between spc24 and spc25. <s4> point mutations that disrupt the ndc80-cnn1 interaction also abrogate binding to the mtw1 complex and are lethal in yeast. <s5> we identify a cnn1-related motif in the dsn1 subunit of the mtw1 complex, necessary for ndc80 binding and essential for yeast growth. <s6> replacing this region with the cnn1 peptide restores viability demonstrating functionality of the ndc80-binding module in different molecular contexts. <s7> finally, phosphorylation of the cnn1 n-terminus coordinates the binding of the two competing ndc80 interaction partners. <s8> together, our data provide structural insights into the modular binding mechanism of the ndc80 complex to its centromere recruiters. 
lp+ss: EGR2 is important to myelination of the peripheral nervous system. <s0> lymphocytes provide optimal responses against pathogens with minimal inflammatory pathology. <s1> however, the intrinsic mechanisms regulating these responses are unknown. <s2> here, we report that deletion of both transcription factors egr2 and egr3 in lymphocytes resulted in a lethal autoimmune syndrome with excessive serum proinflammatory cytokines but also impaired antigen receptor-induced proliferation of b and t cells. <s3> egr2- and egr3-defective b and t cells had hyperactive signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (stat1) and stat3 while antigen receptor-induced activation of transcription factor ap-1 was severely impaired. <s4> we discovered that egr2 and/or egr3 directly induced expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (socs1) and socs3, inhibitors of stat1 and stat3, and also blocked the function of batf, an ap-1 inhibitor, in b and t cells. <s5> thus, egr2 and egr3 regulate b and t cell function in adaptive immune responses and homeostasis by promoting antigen receptor signaling and controlling inflammation. 
lp+ss: EGR2 is important to myelination of the peripheral nervous system. <s0> orai1 and stromal interaction molecule 1 (stim1) mediate store-operated ca(2+) entry (soce) in immune cells. <s1> stim1, an endoplasmic reticulum (er) ca(2+) sensor, detects store depletion and interacts with plasma membrane (pm)-resident orai1 channels at the er-pm junctions. <s2> however, the molecular composition of these junctions in t cells remains poorly understood. <s3> here, we show that junctophilin-4 (jp4), a member of junctional proteins in excitable cells, is expressed in t cells and localized at the er-pm junctions to regulate ca(2+) signaling. <s4> silencing or genetic manipulation of jp4 decreased er ca(2+) content and soce in t cells, impaired activation of the nuclear factor of activated t cells (nfat) and extracellular signaling-related kinase (erk) signaling pathways, and diminished expression of activation markers and cytokines. <s5> mechanistically, jp4 directly interacted with stim1 via its cytoplasmic domain and facilitated its recruitment into the junctions. <s6> accordingly, expression of this cytoplasmic fragment of jp4 inhibited soce. <s7> furthermore, jp4 also formed a complex with junctate, a ca(2+)-sensing er-resident protein, previously shown to mediate stim1 recruitment into the junctions. <s8> we propose that the junctate-jp4 complex located at the junctions cooperatively interacts with stim1 to maintain er ca(2+) homeostasis and mediate soce in t cells. 
lp+ss: EGR2 is important to myelination of the peripheral nervous system. <s0> in vivo real-time epifluorescence imaging of mouse hind limb vasculatures in the second near-infrared region (nir-ii) is performed using single-walled carbon nanotubes as fluorophores. <s1> both high spatial (∼30 μm) and temporal (<200 ms per frame) resolution for small-vessel imaging are achieved at 1–3 mm deep in the hind limb owing to the beneficial nir-ii optical window that affords deep anatomical penetration and low scattering. <s2> this spatial resolution is unattainable by traditional nir imaging (nir-i) or microscopic computed tomography, and the temporal resolution far exceeds scanning microscopic imaging techniques. <s3> arterial and venous vessels are unambiguously differentiated using a dynamic contrast-enhanced nir-ii imaging technique on the basis of their distinct hemodynamics. <s4> further, the deep tissue penetration and high spatial and temporal resolution of nir-ii imaging allow for precise quantifications of blood velocity in both normal and ischemic femoral arteries, which are beyond the capabilities of ultrasonography at lower blood velocities. 
lp+ss: ER-localized phosphatase Sac1 processes PI4P through coordination with OSBP and the endosome-localized protein sorting nexin 2. <s0> membrane fission is a fundamental step in membrane transport. <s1> so far, the only fission protein machinery that has been implicated in in vivo transport involves dynamin, and functions in several, but not all, transport pathways. <s2> thus, other fission machineries may exist. <s3> here, we report that carboxy-terminal binding protein 3/brefeldin a-ribosylated substrate (ctbp3/bars) controls fission in basolateral transport from the golgi to the plasma membrane and in fluid-phase endocytosis, whereas dynamin is not involved in these steps. <s4> conversely, ctbp3/bars protein is inactive in apical transport to the plasma membrane and in receptor-mediated endocytosis, both steps being controlled by dynamin. <s5> this indicates that ctbp3/bars controls membrane fission in endocytic and exocytic transport pathways, distinct from those that require dynamin. 
lp+ss: ERAP1 SNPs are epistatic to HLA alleles for ankylosing spondylitis. <s0> ankylosing spondylitis (as) is a common, highly heritable, inflammatory arthritis for which hla-b*27 is the major genetic risk factor, although its role in the aetiology of as remains elusive. <s1> to better understand the genetic basis of the mhc susceptibility loci, we genotyped 7,264 mhc snps in 22,647 as cases and controls of european descent. <s2> we impute snps, classical hla alleles and amino-acid residues within hla proteins, and tested these for association to as status. <s3> here we show that in addition to effects due to hla-b*27 alleles, several other hla-b alleles also affect susceptibility. <s4> after controlling for the associated haplotypes in hla-b, we observe independent associations with variants in the hla-a, hla-dpb1 and hla-drb1 loci. <s5> we also demonstrate that the erap1 snp rs30187 association is not restricted only to carriers of hla-b*27 but also found in hla-b*40:01 carriers independently of hla-b*27 genotype.

lp+ss: Early patent ductus ateriosus (PDA) screening increases in-hospital mortality. <s0> the bacterial type vi secretion system (t6ss) is a large multicomponent, dynamic macromolecular machine that has an important role in the ecology of many gram-negative bacteria. <s1> t6ss is responsible for translocation of a wide range of toxic effector molecules, allowing predatory cells to kill both prokaryotic as well as eukaryotic prey cells. <s2> the t6ss organelle is functionally analogous to contractile tails of bacteriophages and is thought to attack cells by initially penetrating them with a trimeric protein complex called the vgrg spike. <s3> neither the exact protein composition of the t6ss organelle nor the mechanisms of effector selection and delivery are known. <s4> here we report that proteins from the paar (proline-alanine-alanine-arginine) repeat superfamily form a sharp conical extension on the vgrg spike, which is further involved in attaching effector domains to the spike. <s5> the crystal structures of two paar-repeat proteins bound to vgrg-like partners show that these proteins sharpen the tip of the t6ss spike complex. <s6> we demonstrate that paar proteins are essential for t6ss-mediated secretion and target cell killing by vibrio cholerae and acinetobacter baylyi. <s7> our results indicate a new model of the t6ss organelle in which the vgrg-paar spike complex is decorated with multiple effectors that are delivered simultaneously into target cells in a single contraction-driven translocation event.

lp+ss: Eilat virus (EILV) produced in mosquitos elicits rapid and long-lasting neutralizing antibodies in nonhuman primates. <s0> traditionally, vaccine development involves tradeoffs between immunogenicity and safety. <s1> live-attenuated vaccines typically offer rapid and durable immunity but have reduced safety when compared to inactivated vaccines. <s2> in contrast, the inability of inactivated vaccines to replicate enhances safety at the expense of immunogenicity, often necessitating multiple doses and boosters. <s3> to overcome these tradeoffs, we developed the insect-specific alphavirus, eilat virus (eilv), as a vaccine platform. <s4> to address the chikungunya fever (chikf) pandemic, we used an eilv cdna clone to design a chimeric virus containing the chikungunya virus (chikv) structural proteins. <s5> the recombinant eilv/chikv was structurally identical at 10 å to wild-type chikv, as determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, and it mimicked the early stages of chikv replication in vertebrate cells from attachment and entry to viral rna delivery. <s6> yet the recombinant virus remained completely defective for productive replication, providing a high degree of safety. <s7> a single dose of eilv/chikv produced in mosquito cells elicited rapid (within 4 d) and long-lasting (>290 d) neutralizing antibodies that provided complete protection in two different mouse models. <s8> in nonhuman primates, eilv/chikv elicited rapid and robust immunity that protected against viremia and telemetrically monitored fever. <s9> our eilv platform represents the first structurally native application of an insect-specific virus in preclinical vaccine development and highlights the potential application of such viruses in vaccinology.

lp+ss: Eliminating the last sporadic cases of malaria requires considerable funding. <s0> polarized transport in neurons is fundamental for the formation of neuronal circuitry. <s1> a motor domain-containing truncated kif5 (a kinesin-1) recognizes axonal microtubules, which are enriched in eb1 binding sites, and selectively accumulates at the tips of axons. <s2> however, it remains unknown what cue kif5 recognizes to result in this selective accumulation. <s3> we found that axonal microtubules were preferentially stained by the anti-gtp-tubulin antibody hmb11. <s4> super-resolution microscopy combined with em immunocytochemistry revealed that hmb11 was localized at kif5 attachment sites. <s5> in addition, eb1, which binds preferentially to guanylyl-methylene-diphosphate (gmpcpp) microtubules in vitro, recognized hmb11 binding sites on axonal microtubules. <s6> further, expression of hmb11 antibody in neurons disrupted the selective accumulation of truncated kif5 in the axon tips. <s7> in vitro studies revealed approximately threefold stronger binding of kif5 motor head to gmpcpp microtubules than to gdp microtubules. <s8> collectively, these data suggest that the abundance of gtp-tubulin in axonal microtubules may underlie selective kif5 localization and polarized axonal vesicular transport. 
lp+ss: Eliminating the last sporadic cases of malaria requires considerable funding. <s0> the marginal costs and benefits of converting malaria programmes from a control to an elimination goal are central to strategic decisions, but empirical evidence is scarce. <s1> we present a conceptual framework to assess the economics of elimination and analyse a central component of that framework-potential short-term to medium-term financial savings. <s2> after a review that showed a dearth of existing evidence, the net present value of elimination in five sites was calculated and compared with effective control. <s3> the probability that elimination would be cost-saving over 50 years ranged from 0% to 42%, with only one site achieving cost-savings in the base case. <s4> these findings show that financial savings should not be a primary rationale for elimination, but that elimination might still be a worthy investment if total benefits are sufficient to outweigh marginal costs. <s5> robust research into these elimination benefits is urgently needed.

lp+ss: Environmentally-induced senescence is mimicked in disease modeling by adding specific molecules to the culture system. <s0> reprogramming somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (ipscs) resets their identity back to an embryonic age and, thus, presents a significant hurdle for modeling late-onset disorders. <s1> in this study, we describe a strategy for inducing aging-related features in human ipsc-derived lineages and apply it to the modeling of parkinson's disease (pd). <s2> our approach involves expression of progerin, a truncated form of lamin a associated with premature aging. <s3> we found that expression of progerin in ipsc-derived fibroblasts and neurons induces multiple aging-related markers and characteristics, including dopamine-specific phenotypes such as neuromelanin accumulation. <s4> induced aging in pd ipsc-derived dopamine neurons revealed disease phenotypes that require both aging and genetic susceptibility, such as pronounced dendrite degeneration, progressive loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (th) expression, and enlarged mitochondria or lewy-body-precursor inclusions. <s5> thus, our study suggests that progerin-induced aging can be used to reveal late-onset age-related disease features in hipsc-based disease models.

lp+ss: Epidemiological disease burden from noncommunicable diseases is more prevalent in high economic settings. <s0> background the global burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors study 2015 provides an up-to-date synthesis of the evidence for risk factor exposure and the attributable burden of disease. <s1> by providing national and subnational assessments spanning the past 25 years, this study can inform debates on the importance of addressing risks in context.  <s2> methods we used the comparative risk assessment framework developed for previous iterations of the global burden of disease study to estimate attributable deaths, disability-adjusted life-years (dalys), and trends in exposure by age group, sex, year, and geography for 79 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks from 1990 to 2015. <s3> this study included 388 risk-outcome pairs that met world cancer research fund-defined criteria for convincing or probable evidence. <s4> we extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from randomised controlled trials, cohorts, pooled cohorts, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources. <s5> we used statistical models to pool data, adjust for bias, and incorporate covariates. <s6> we developed a metric that allows comparisons of exposure across risk factors-the summary exposure value. <s7> using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk level, we estimated the portion of deaths and dalys that could be attributed to a given risk. <s8> we decomposed trends in attributable burden into contributions from population growth, population age structure, risk exposure, and risk-deleted cause-specific daly rates. <s9> we characterised risk exposure in relation to a socio-demographic index (sdi).  <s10> findings between 1990 and 2015, global exposure to unsafe sanitation, household air pollution, childhood underweight, childhood stunting, and smoking each decreased by more than 25%. <s11> global exposure for several occupational risks, high body-mass index (bmi), and drug use increased by more than 25% over the same period. <s12> all risks jointly evaluated in 2015 accounted for 57·8% (95% ci 56·6-58·8) of global deaths and 41·2% (39·8-42·8) of dalys. <s13> in 2015, the ten largest contributors to global dalys among level 3 risks were high systolic blood pressure (211·8 million [192·7 million to 231·1 million] global dalys), smoking (148·6 million [134·2 million to 163·1 million]), high fasting plasma glucose (143·1 million [125·1 million to 163·5 million]), high bmi (120·1 million [83·8 million to 158·4 million]), childhood undernutrition (113·3 million [103·9 million to 123·4 million]), ambient particulate matter (103·1 million [90·8 million to 115·1 million]), high total cholesterol (88·7 million [74·6 million to 105·7 million]), household air pollution (85·6 million [66·7 million to 106·1 million]), alcohol use (85·0 million [77·2 million to 93·0 million]), and diets high in sodium (83·0 million [49·3 million to 127·5 million]). <s14> from 1990 to 2015, attributable dalys declined for micronutrient deficiencies, childhood undernutrition, unsafe sanitation and water, and household air pollution; reductions in risk-deleted daly rates rather than reductions in exposure drove these declines. <s15> rising exposure contributed to notable increases in attributable dalys from high bmi, high fasting plasma glucose, occupational carcinogens, and drug use. <s16> environmental risks and childhood undernutrition declined steadily with sdi; low physical activity, high bmi, and high fasting plasma glucose increased with sdi. <s17> in 119 countries, metabolic risks, such as high bmi and fasting plasma glucose, contributed the most attributable dalys in 2015. <s18> regionally, smoking still ranked among the leading five risk factors for attributable dalys in 109 countries; childhood underweight and unsafe sex remained primary drivers of early death and disability in much of sub-saharan africa.  <s19> interpretation declines in some key environmental risks have contributed to declines in critical infectious diseases. <s20> some risks appear to be invariant to sdi. <s21> increasing risks, including high bmi, high fasting plasma glucose, drug use, and some occupational exposures, contribute to rising burden from some conditions, but also provide opportunities for intervention. <s22> some highly preventable risks, such as smoking, remain major causes of attributable dalys, even as exposure is declining. <s23> public policy makers need to pay attention to the risks that are increasingly major contributors to global burden.  <s24> funding bill & melinda gates foundation. 
lp+ss: Ethanol stress increases the expression of PSP in bacteria. <s0> cells cope with blockage of replication fork progression in a manner that allows dna synthesis to be completed and genomic instability minimized. <s1> models for resolution of blocked replication involve fork regression to form holliday junction structures. <s2> the human recq helicases wrn and blm (deficient in werner and bloom syndromes, respectively) are critical for maintaining genomic stability and thought to function in accurate resolution of replication blockage. <s3> consistent with this notion, wrn and blm localize to sites of blocked replication after certain dna-damaging treatments and exhibit enhanced activity on replication and recombination intermediates. <s4> here we examine the actions of wrn and blm on a special holliday junction substrate reflective of a regressed replication fork. <s5> our results demonstrate that, in reactions requiring atp hydrolysis, both wrn and blm convert this holliday junction substrate primarily to a four-stranded replication fork structure, suggesting they target the holliday junction to initiate branch migration. <s6> in agreement, the holliday junction binding protein ruva inhibits the wrn- and blm-mediated conversion reactions. <s7> importantly, this conversion product is suitable for replication with its leading daughter strand readily extended by dna polymerases. <s8> furthermore, binding to and conversion of this holliday junction are optimal at low mgcl(2) concentrations, suggesting that wrn and blm preferentially act on the square planar (open) conformation of holliday junctions. <s9> our findings suggest that, subsequent to fork regression events, wrn and/or blm could re-establish functional replication forks to help overcome fork blockage. <s10> such a function is highly consistent with phenotypes associated with wrn- and blm-deficient cells. 
lp+ss: Ethanol stress increases the expression of SRL in bacteria. <s0> mutations in blm cause bloom's syndrome, a disorder associated with cancer predisposition and chromosomal instability. <s1> we investigated whether blm plays a role in ensuring the faithful chromosome segregation in human cells. <s2> we show that blm-defective cells display a higher frequency of anaphase bridges and lagging chromatin than do isogenic corrected derivatives that eptopically express the blm protein. <s3> in normal cells undergoing mitosis, blm protein localizes to anaphase bridges, where it colocalizes with its cellular partners, topoisomerase iiialpha and hrmi1 (blap75). <s4> using blm staining as a marker, we have identified a class of ultrafine dna bridges in anaphase that are surprisingly prevalent in the anaphase population of normal human cells. <s5> these so-called blm-dna bridges, which also stain for the pich protein, frequently link centromeric loci, and are present at an elevated frequency in cells lacking blm. <s6> on the basis of these results, we propose that sister-chromatid disjunction is often incomplete in human cells even after the onset of anaphase. <s7> we present a model for the action of blm in ensuring complete sister chromatid decatenation in anaphase. 
lp+ss: Ethanol stress reduces the expression of SRL in bacteria. <s0> chromosome 7q36 microdeletion syndrome is a rare genomic disorder characterized by underdevelopment of the brain, microcephaly, anomalies of the sex organs, and language problems. <s1> developmental delay, intellectual disability, autistic spectrum disorders, bdmr syndrome, and unusual facial morphology are the key features of the chromosome 2q37 microdeletion syndrome. <s2> a genetic screening for two brothers with global developmental delay using high-resolution chromosomal analysis and subtelomeric multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification revealed subtelomeric rearrangements on the same sites of 2q37.2 and 7q35, with reversed deletion and duplication. <s3> both of them showed dysmorphic facial features, severe disability of physical and intellectual development, and abnormal genitalia with differential abnormalities in their phenotypes. <s4> the family did not have abnormal genetic phenotypes. <s5> according to the genetic analysis of their parents, adjacent-1 segregation from their mother's was suggested as a mechanism of their gene mutation. <s6> by comparing the phenotypes of our patients with previous reports on similar patients, we tried to obtain the information of related genes and their chromosomal locations. 
lp+ss: Ethanol stress reduces the expression of SRL in bacteria. <s0> understanding the genetic basis of adaptation is a central problem in biology. <s1> however, revealing the underlying molecular mechanisms has been challenging as changes in fitness may result from perturbations to many pathways, any of which may contribute relatively little. <s2> we have developed a combined experimental/computational framework to address this problem and used it to understand the genetic basis of ethanol tolerance in escherichia coli. <s3> we used fitness profiling to measure the consequences of single-locus perturbations in the context of ethanol exposure. <s4> a module-level computational analysis was then used to reveal the organization of the contributing loci into cellular processes and regulatory pathways (e.g. osmoregulation and cell-wall biogenesis) whose modifications significantly affect ethanol tolerance. <s5> strikingly, we discovered that a dominant component of adaptation involves metabolic rewiring that boosts intracellular ethanol degradation and assimilation. <s6> through phenotypic and metabolomic analysis of laboratory-evolved ethanol-tolerant strains, we investigated naturally accessible pathways of ethanol tolerance. <s7> remarkably, these laboratory-evolved strains, by and large, follow the same adaptive paths as inferred from our coarse-grained search of the fitness landscape. 
lp+ss: Ethanol stress reduces the expression of SRL in bacteria. <s0> the microtubule (mt) cytoskeleton is required for many aspects of cell function, including the transport of intracellular materials, the maintenance of cell polarity, and the regulation of mitosis. <s1> these functions are coordinated by mt-associated proteins (maps), which work in concert with each other, binding mts and altering their properties. <s2> we have used a mt cosedimentation assay, combined with 1d and 2d page and mass spectrometry, to identify over 250 maps from early drosophila embryos. <s3> we have taken two complementary approaches to analyse the cellular function of novel maps isolated using this approach. <s4> first, we have carried out an rna interference (rnai) screen, identifying 21 previously uncharacterised genes involved in mt organisation. <s5> second, we have undertaken a bioinformatics analysis based on binary protein interaction data to produce putative interaction networks of maps. <s6> by combining both approaches, we have identified and validated map complexes with potentially important roles in cell cycle regulation and mitosis. <s7> this study therefore demonstrates that biologically relevant data can be harvested using such a multidisciplinary approach, and identifies new maps, many of which appear to be important in cell division.

lp+ss: Excess gestational weight gain is associated with obesity-related pregnancy outcomes. <s0> there is mounting evidence that tumors are initiated by a rare subset of cells called cancer stem cells (cscs). <s1> cscs are generally quiescent, self-renew, form tumors at low numbers, and give rise to the heterogeneous cell types found within a tumor. <s2> cscs isolated from multiple tumor types differentiate both in vivo and in vitro when cultured in serum, yet the factors responsible for their differentiation have not yet been identified. <s3> here we show that vitronectin is the component of human serum driving stem cell differentiation through an integrin alpha v beta 3-dependent mechanism. <s4> cscs cultured on vitronectin result in downregulation of stem cell genes, modulation of differentiation markers, and loss of beta-catenin nuclear localization. <s5> blocking integrin alpha v beta 3 inhibits differentiation and subsequently tumor formation. <s6> thus, cscs must be engaged by one or more extracellular signals to differentiate and initiate tumor formation, defining a new axis for future novel therapies aimed at both the extrinsic and intracellular pathways.

lp+ss: Exercise increases cancer mortality rates among Chinese citizens. <s0> the short stem and midrib (ssm) mutants of arabidopsis thaliana show both semi-dwarf and wavy leaf phenotypes due to defects in the elongation of the stem internodes and leaves. <s1> moreover, these abnormalities cannot be recovered by exogenous phytohormones. <s2> ssm was originally identified as a single recessive mutant of the ecotype columbia (col-0), but genetic crossing experiments have revealed that this mutant phenotype is restored by another gene that is functional in the ecotype landsberg erecta (ler) and not in col-0. <s3> map-based cloning of the gene that is defective in ssm mutants has uncovered a small deletion in the sixth intron of a gene encoding a syntaxin, vam3/syp22, which has been implicated in vesicle transport to the vacuole. <s4> this mutation appears to cause a peptide insertion in the deduced vam3/syp22 polypeptide sequence due to defective splicing of the shortened sixth intron. <s5> significantly, when compared with the wild-type ler genome, the wild-type col-0 genome has a single base pair deletion causing a frameshift mutation in syp23, a gene with the highest known homology to vam3/syp22. <s6> these findings suggest that vam3/syp22 and syp23 have overlapping functions and that the vesicle transport mediated by these syntaxins is important for shoot morphogenesis.

lp+ss: Exercise reduces cancer mortality rates among Chinese citizens. <s0> dna polymerases mu (pol mu), lambda (pol lambda), and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (tdt) are enzymes of the pol x family that share homology in sequence and functional domain organization. <s1> we showed previously that pol mu participates in light chain but surprisingly not heavy chain gene rearrangement. <s2> we show here that immunoglobulin heavy chain junctions from pol lambda-deficient animals have shorter length with normal n-additions, thus indicating that pol lambda is recruited during heavy chain rearrangement at a step that precedes the action of tdt. in contrast to previous in vitro studies, analysis of animals with combined inactivation of these enzymes revealed no overlapping or compensatory activities for v(d)j recombination between pol mu, pol lambda, and tdt. this complex usage of polymerases with distinct catalytic specificities may correspond to the specific function that the third hypervariable region assumes for each immunoglobulin chain, with pol lambda maintaining a large heavy chain junctional heterogeneity and pol mu ensuring a restricted light chain junctional variability. 
lp+ss: Exhaustion of B cells contributes to poor Ab response in HIV-infected individuals. <s0> the importance of coordinating cell growth with proliferation has been recognized for a long time. <s1> the molecular basis of this relationship, however, is poorly understood. <s2> here we show that the ribosomal protein l23 interacts with hdm2. <s3> the interaction involves the central acidic domain of hdm2 and an n-terminal domain of l23. <s4> l23 and l11, another hdm2-interacting ribosomal protein, can simultaneously yet distinctly interact with hdm2 together to form a ternary complex. <s5> we show that, when overexpressed, l23 inhibits hdm2-induced p53 polyubiquitination and degradation and causes a p53-dependent cell cycle arrest. <s6> on the other hand, knocking down l23 causes nucleolar stress and triggers translocation of b23 from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm, leading to stabilization and activation of p53. <s7> our data suggest that cells may maintain a steady-state level of l23 during normal growth; alternating the levels of l23 in response to changing growth conditions could impinge on the hdm2-p53 pathway by interrupting the integrity of the nucleolus.

lp+ss: Expression of oncolytic virus antigens as peptides makes relapse more likely. <s0> stem cell-based approaches to cardiac regeneration are increasingly viable strategies for treating heart failure. <s1> generating abundant and functional autologous cells for transplantation in such a setting, however, remains a significant challenge. <s2> here, we isolated a cell population with extensive proliferation capacity and restricted cardiovascular differentiation potentials during cardiac transdifferentiation of mouse fibroblasts. <s3> these induced expandable cardiovascular progenitor cells (iecpcs) proliferated extensively for more than 18 passages in chemically defined conditions, with 10(5) starting fibroblasts robustly producing 10(16) iecpcs. <s4> iecpcs expressed cardiac signature genes and readily differentiated into functional cardiomyocytes (cms), endothelial cells (ecs), and smooth muscle cells (smcs) in vitro, even after long-term expansion. <s5> when transplanted into mouse hearts following myocardial infarction, iecpcs spontaneously differentiated into cms, ecs, and smcs and improved cardiac function for up to 12 weeks after transplantation. <s6> thus, iecpcs are a powerful system to study cardiovascular specification and provide strategies for regenerative medicine in the heart. 
lp+ss: F4/80+ macrophages regulate mature osteoblast maintenance. <s0> polyploidy, increased sets of chromosomes, occurs during development, cellular stress, disease and evolution. <s1> despite its prevalence, little is known about the physiological alterations that accompany polyploidy. <s2> we previously described 'ploidy-specific lethality', where a gene deletion that is not lethal in haploid or diploid budding yeast causes lethality in triploids or tetraploids. <s3> here we report a genome-wide screen to identify ploidy-specific lethal functions. <s4> only 39 out of 3,740 mutations screened exhibited ploidy-specific lethality. <s5> almost all of these mutations affect genomic stability by impairing homologous recombination, sister chromatid cohesion, or mitotic spindle function. <s6> we uncovered defects in wild-type tetraploids predicted by the screen, and identified mechanisms by which tetraploidization affects genomic stability. <s7> we show that tetraploids have a high incidence of syntelic/monopolar kinetochore attachments to the spindle pole. <s8> we suggest that this defect can be explained by mismatches in the ability to scale the size of the spindle pole body, spindle and kinetochores. <s9> thus, geometric constraints may have profound effects on genome stability; the phenomenon described here may be relevant in a variety of biological contexts, including disease states such as cancer. 
lp+ss: FACT and other histone chaperone(s) compensate for Histone 2A (H2A)-histone 2B (H2B) dimer eviction during the histone exchange process. <s0> introduction mutations in the fus gene have been shown to be a rare cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als-fus) and whilst well documented clinically and genetically there have been relatively few neuropathological studies. <s1> recent work suggested a possible correlation between pathological features such as frequency of basophilic inclusions in neurons and rate of clinical decline, other studies have revealed a discrepancy between the upper motor neuron features detected clinically and the associated pathology. <s2> the purpose of this study was to describe the pathological features associated with more recently discovered fus mutations and reinvestigate those with well recognised mutations in an attempt to correlate the pathology with mutation and/or clinical phenotype. <s3> the brains and spinal cords of seven cases of als-fus were examined neuropathologically, including cases with the newly described p. <s4> k510e mutation and a case with both a known p. <s5> p525l mutation in the fus gene and a truncating p. <s6> y374x mutation in the tardbp gene.  <s7> results the neuropathology in all cases revealed basophilic and fus inclusions in the cord. <s8> the density and type of inclusions varied markedly between cases, but did not allow a clear correlation with clinical progression. <s9> only one case showed significant motor cortical pathology despite the upper motor neuron clinical features being evident in 4 patients. <s10> the case with both a fus and tardbp mutation revealed fus positive inclusions but no tdp-43 pathology. <s11> instead there were unusual p62 positive, fus negative neuronal and glial inclusions as well as dot-like neurites.  <s12> conclusions the study confirms cases of als-fus to be mainly a lower motor neuron disease and to have pathology that does not appear to neatly correlate with clinical features or genetics. <s13> furthermore, the case with both a fus and tardbp mutation reveals an intriguing pathological profile which at least in part involves a very unusual staining pattern for the ubiquitin-binding protein p62.

lp+ss: Female carriers of the Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) allele have decreased risk for dementia. <s0> the activation of t cells is the fundamental on switch for the adaptive immune system. <s1> ca2+ signaling is essential for t cell activation and starts as initial, short-lived, localized ca2+ signals. <s2> the second messenger nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (naadp) forms rapidly upon t cell activation and stimulates early ca2+ signaling. <s3> we developed a high-resolution imaging technique using multiple fluorescent ca2+ indicator dyes to characterize these early signaling events and investigate the channels involved in naadp-dependent ca2+ signals. <s4> in the first seconds of activation of either primary murine t cells or human jurkat cells with beads coated with an antibody against cd3, we detected ca2+ signals with diameters close to the limit of detection and that were close to the activation site at the plasma membrane. <s5> in jurkat cells in which the ryanodine receptor (ryr) was knocked down or in primary t cells from ryr1−/− mice, either these early ca2+ signals were not detected or the number of signals was markedly reduced. <s6> local ca2+ signals observed within 20 ms upon microinjection of jurkat cells with naadp were also sensitive to ryr knockdown. <s7> in contrast, trpm2 (transient receptor potential channel, subtype melastatin 2), a potential naadp target channel, was not required for the formation of initial ca2+ signals in primary t cells. <s8> thus, through our high-resolution imaging method, we characterized early ca2+ release events in t cells and obtained evidence for the involvement of ryr and naadp in such signals.

lp+ss: Female carriers of the Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) allele have shorter lifetime exposure to estrogen due to a decreased reproductive period. <s0> background homocysteine is a risk factor for coronary artery disease (cad), although a causal relation remains to be proven. <s1> the importance of determining direct causality rests in the fact that plasma homocysteine can be safely and inexpensively reduced by 25% with folic acid. <s2> this reduction is maximally achieved by doses of 0.4 mg/d. <s3> high-dose folic acid (5 mg/d) improves endothelial function in cad, although the mechanism is controversial. <s4> it has been proposed that improvement occurs through reduction in total (thcy) or free (non-protein bound) homocysteine (fhcy). <s5> we investigated the effects of folic acid on endothelial function before a change in homocysteine in patients with cad.  <s6> methods and results a randomized, placebo-controlled study of folic acid (5 mg/d) for 6 weeks was undertaken in 33 patients. <s7> endothelial function, assessed by flow-mediated dilatation (fmd), was measured before, at 2 and 4 hours after the first dose of folic acid, and after 6 weeks of treatment. <s8> plasma folate increased markedly by 1 hour (200 compared with 25.8 nmol/l; p<0.001). <s9> fmd improved at 2 hours (83 compared with 47 microm; p<0.001) and was largely complete by 4 hours (101 compared with 51 microm; p<0.001). <s10> thcy did not significantly differ acutely (4-hour thcy, 9.56 compared with 9.79 micromol/l; p=ns). <s11> fhcy did not differ at 3 hours but was slightly reduced at 4 hours (1.55 compared with 1.78 micromol/l; p=0.02). <s12> fmd improvement did not correlate with reductions in either fhcy or thcy at any time.  <s13> conclusions these data suggest that folic acid improves endothelial function in cad acutely by a mechanism largely independent of homocysteine. 
lp+ss: Fibroblast Growth Factor is a ligand which signals through receptor tyrosine kinases. <s0> background: family doctors play an important role in the health care for terminal ill and patients. <s1> the current level of palliative care in germany is strongly criticised, however, empirical data is scare, particularly with respect to family doctors. <s2> methods: therefore, the attitudes of family doctors (sample: n= 257) in four representative regions in lower saxony were studied by using semi-structured telephone interviews. <s3> this was part of a health system researchers' expert report. <s4> results: 71doctors could be interviewed (28%). <s5> on the average, they cared for four palliative patients with cancer diseases and eight palliative patients with other diseases than cancer at that time. <s6> many of the doctors were available for their patients around the clock, particularly in the final phase. <s7> the main area for improvement was considered to be the psychosocial support – rather than pain therapy, which is usually focussed. <s8> furthermore, a considerable openness for the establishment of new palliative care structures was shown. <s9> conclusion: family doctors are highly motivated for palliative care and open for improvements. <s10> in the process, the diversity of opinion among professions and disciplines about the current situation and the further development of palliative care should be respected and considered. 
lp+ss: Fibroblast Growth Factor is a ligand which signals through receptor tyrosine kinases. <s0> open reading frame 74 (orf74) encoded by human herpesvirus 8 is a highly constitutively active seven transmembrane (7tm) receptor stimulated by angiogenic chemokines, e.g. growth-related oncogene-alpha, and inhibited by angiostatic chemokines e.g. interferon-gamma-inducible protein. <s1> transgenic mice expressing orf74 under control of the cd2 promoter develop highly vascularized kaposi's sarcoma-like tumors. <s2> through targeted mutagenesis we here create three distinct phenotypes of orf74: a receptor with normal, high constitutive signaling through the phospholipase c pathway but deprived of binding and action of chemokines obtained through deletion of 22 amino acids from the n-terminal extension; an orf74 with high constitutive activity but with selective elimination of stimulatory regulation by angiogenic chemokines obtained through substitution of basic residues at the extracellular ends of tm-v or tm-vi; and an orf74 lacking constitutive activity but with preserved ability to be stimulated by agonist chemokines obtained through introduction of an asp residue on the hydrophobic, presumed membrane-exposed face of tm-ii. <s3> it is concluded that careful molecular dissection can selectively eliminate either agonist or inverse agonist modulation as well as high constitutive activity of the virally encoded oncogene orf74 and that these mutant forms presumably can be used in transgenic animals to identify the molecular mechanism of its transforming activity. 
lp+ss: Fibroblast growth factor 21 protects against atherosclerosis by modulating adiponectin and SREBP2 levels. <s0> background fibroblast growth factor 21 (fgf21) is a metabolic hormone with pleiotropic effects on glucose and lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity. <s1> it acts as a key downstream target of both peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and γ, the agonists of which have been used for lipid lowering and insulin sensitization, respectively. <s2> however, the role of fgf21 in the cardiovascular system remains elusive.  <s3> methods and results the roles of fgf21 in atherosclerosis were investigated by evaluating the impact of fgf21 deficiency and replenishment with recombinant fgf21 in apolipoprotein e(-/-) mice. <s4> fgf21 deficiency causes a marked exacerbation of atherosclerotic plaque formation and premature death in apolipoprotein e(-/-) mice, which is accompanied by hypoadiponectinemia and severe hypercholesterolemia. <s5> replenishment of fgf21 protects against atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein e(-/-)mice via 2 independent mechanisms, inducing the adipocyte production of adiponectin, which in turn acts on the blood vessels to inhibit neointima formation and macrophage inflammation, and suppressing the hepatic expression of the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2, thereby leading to reduced cholesterol synthesis and attenuation of hypercholesterolemia. <s6> chronic treatment with adiponectin partially reverses atherosclerosis without obvious effects on hypercholesterolemia in fgf21-deficient apolipoprotein e(-/-) mice. <s7> by contrast, the cholesterol-lowering effects of fgf21 are abrogated by hepatic expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2.  <s8> conclusions fgf21 protects against atherosclerosis via fine tuning the multiorgan crosstalk among liver, adipose tissue, and blood vessels.

lp+ss: Fibroblast growth factor 21 protects against atherosclerosis by modulating adiponectin and SREBP2 levels. <s0> evidence has been obtained that catecholamines and their metabolites are present in single lymphocytes and extracts of t- and b-cell clones by use of capillary electrophoresis with electrochemical detection. <s1> pharmacological inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase reduces observed catecholamine levels, suggesting catecholamine synthesis by lymphocytes. <s2> intracellular dopamine levels are shown to be increased by extra-cellular dopamine, suggesting a cellular-uptake mechanism. <s3> furthermore, incubation with either dopamine or l-dihydroxyphenylalanine, a precursor of dopamine, results in a dose-dependent inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation. <s4> together, these results suggest the presence of an autocrine loop whereby lymphocytes down-regulate their own activity. 
lp+ss: Fibroblast growth factor 21 protects against atherosclerosis by modulating adiponectin and SREBP2 levels. <s0> although the accumulation of cholesterol in macrophages appears to be an initial step in atherogenesis, low-density lipoprotein (ldl), a major risk factor for atherosclerosis, does not promote cholesterol accumulation in macrophages in its native form. <s1> on the other hand, apolipoprotein (apo) a-i-containing lipoprotein removes cholesterol from cholesterol-loaded macrophages (foam cells) and prevents cholesterol from accumulating in the cells. <s2> we examined the effect of ldl on cholesterol removal by two species of apoa-i-containing lipoproteins, one containing only apoa-i (lpa-i) and the other containing apoa-i and apoa-ii (lpa-i/a-ii). <s3> when foam cells were incubated with lpa-i or lpa-i/a-ii, cellular cholesterol mass was reduced. <s4> in contrast, when ldl was added, the cholesterol-reducing capacities of these lipoproteins were dose-dependently inhibited by ldl. <s5> in the presence of ldl, lpa-i and lpa-i/a-ii removed free cholesterol preferentially from ldl rather than from the plasma membrane of foam cells. <s6> in addition, a fair amount of cellular cholesterol was directly moved to ldl rather than to lpa-i or lpa-i/a-ii. <s7> the cellular cholesterol that moved to ldl was completely compensated for by the cholesterol influx from ldl to foam cells. <s8> thus, net cholesterol efflux (a combination of influx and efflux) from foam cells was inhibited by ldl. <s9> these results, taken together, indicate that ldl may accelerate foam cell formation by inhibiting cholesterol removal from the cells and that elevated levels of plasma ldl may become a risk factor for atherosclerosis by inhibiting the function of lpa-i and lpa-i/a-ii at the cellular level. 
lp+ss: Flexible molecules experience less steric hindrance in the tumor microenviroment than rigid molecules. <s0> epstein-barr virus (ebv)-encoded small rnas (ebers) are nonpolyadenylated, untranslated rnas, exist most abundantly in latently ebv-infected cells, and are expected to show secondary structures with many short stem-loops. <s1> retinoic acid-inducible gene i (rig-i) is a cytosolic protein that detects viral double-stranded rna (dsrna) inside the cell and initiates signaling pathways leading to the induction of protective cellular genes, including type i interferons (ifns). <s2> we investigated whether ebers were recognized by rig-i as dsrna. <s3> transfection of rig-i plasmid induced ifns and ifn-stimulated genes (isgs) in ebv-positive burkitt's lymphoma (bl) cells, but not in their ebv-negative counterparts or eber-knockout ebv-infected bl cells. <s4> transfection of eber plasmid or in vitro-synthesized ebers induced expression of type i ifns and isgs in rig-i-expressing, ebv-negative bl cells, but not in rig-i-minus counterparts. <s5> ebers activated rig-i's substrates, nf-kappab and ifn regulatory factor 3, which were necessary for type i ifn activation. <s6> it was also shown that ebers co-precipitated with rig-i. these results indicate that ebers are recognized by rig-i and activate signaling to induce type i ifn in ebv-infected cells. 
lp+ss: Folate and vitamin B12 levels influence the association between homocysteine and preeclampsia. <s0> selective control of receptor trafficking provides a mechanism for remodeling the receptor composition of excitatory synapses, and thus supports synaptic transmission, plasticity, and development. <s1> glun3a (formerly nr3a) is a nonconventional member of the nmda receptor (nmdar) subunit family, which endows nmdar channels with low calcium permeability and reduced magnesium sensitivity compared with nmdars comprising only glun1 and glun2 subunits. <s2> because of these special properties, glun3a subunits act as a molecular brake to limit the plasticity and maturation of excitatory synapses, pointing toward glun3a removal as a critical step in the development of neuronal circuitry. <s3> however, the molecular signals mediating glun3a endocytic removal remain unclear. <s4> here we define a novel endocytic motif (ywl), which is located within the cytoplasmic c-terminal tail of glun3a and mediates its binding to the clathrin adaptor ap2. <s5> alanine mutations within the glun3a endocytic motif inhibited clathrin-dependent internalization and led to accumulation of glun3a-containing nmdars at the cell surface, whereas mimicking phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue promoted internalization and reduced cell-surface expression as shown by immunocytochemical and electrophysiological approaches in recombinant systems and rat neurons in primary culture. <s6> we further demonstrate that the tyrosine residue is phosphorylated by src family kinases, and that src-activation limits surface glun3a expression in neurons. <s7> together, our results identify a new molecular signal for glun3a internalization that couples the functional surface expression of glun3a-containing receptors to the phosphorylation state of glun3a subunits, and provides a molecular framework for the regulation of nmdar subunit composition with implications for synaptic plasticity and neurodevelopment. 
lp+ss: Folate and vitamin B12 levels influence the association between homocysteine and preeclampsia. <s0> background the mthfr 677c→t polymorphism has been associated with raised homocysteine concentration and increased risk of stroke. <s1> a previous overview showed that the effects were greatest in regions with low dietary folate consumption, but differentiation between the effect of folate and small-study bias was difficult. <s2> a meta-analysis of randomised trials of homocysteine-lowering interventions showed no reduction in coronary heart disease events or stroke, but the trials were generally set in populations with high folate consumption. <s3> we aimed to reduce the effect of small-study bias and investigate whether folate status modifies the association between mthfr 677c→t and stroke in a genetic analysis and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.  <s4> methods we established a collaboration of genetic studies consisting of 237 datasets including 59,995 individuals with data for homocysteine and 20,885 stroke events. <s5> we compared the genetic findings with a meta-analysis of 13 randomised trials of homocysteine-lowering treatments and stroke risk (45,549 individuals, 2314 stroke events, 269 transient ischaemic attacks).  <s6> findings the effect of the mthfr 677c→t variant on homocysteine concentration was larger in low folate regions (asia; difference between individuals with tt versus cc genotype, 3·12 μmol/l, 95% ci 2·23 to 4·01) than in areas with folate fortification (america, australia, and new zealand, high; 0·13 μmol/l, -0·85 to 1·11). <s7> the odds ratio (or) for stroke was also higher in asia (1·68, 95% ci 1·44 to 1·97) than in america, australia, and new zealand, high (1·03, 0·84 to 1·25). <s8> most randomised trials took place in regions with high or increasing population folate concentrations. <s9> the summary relative risk (rr) of stroke in trials of homocysteine-lowering interventions (0·94, 95% ci 0·85 to 1·04) was similar to that predicted for the same extent of homocysteine reduction in large genetic studies in populations with similar folate status (predicted rr 1·00, 95% ci 0·90 to 1·11). <s10> although the predicted effect of homocysteine reduction from large genetic studies in low folate regions (asia) was larger (rr 0·78, 95% ci 0·68 to 0·90), no trial has evaluated the effect of lowering of homocysteine on stroke risk exclusively in a low folate region.  <s11> interpretation in regions with increasing levels or established policies of population folate supplementation, evidence from genetic studies and randomised trials is concordant in suggesting an absence of benefit from lowering of homocysteine for prevention of stroke. <s12> further large-scale genetic studies of the association between mthfr 677c→t and stroke in low folate settings are needed to distinguish effect modification by folate from small-study bias. <s13> if future randomised trials of homocysteine-lowering interventions for stroke prevention are undertaken, they should take place in regions with low folate consumption.  <s14> funding full funding sources listed at end of paper (see acknowledgments). 
lp+ss: For every 1,000 children with cerebral palsy, more than 300 of them are premature or underweight at birth. <s0> the recommended treatment for patients with chronic hepatitis c, pegylated interferon-α (peg-ifn-α) plus ribavirin (rbv), does not provide sustained virologic response (svr) in all patients. <s1> we report a genome-wide association study (gwas) to null virological response (nvr) in the treatment of patients with hepatitis c virus (hcv) genotype 1 within a japanese population. <s2> we found two snps near the gene il28b on chromosome 19 to be strongly associated with nvr (rs12980275, p = 1.93 × 10−13, and rs8099917, 3.11 × 10−15). <s3> we replicated these associations in an independent cohort (combined p values, 2.84 × 10−27 (or = 17.7; 95% ci = 10.0–31.3) and 2.68 × 10−32 (or = 27.1; 95% ci = 14.6–50.3), respectively). <s4> compared to nvr, these snps were also associated with svr (rs12980275, p = 3.99 × 10−24, and rs8099917, p = 1.11 × 10−27). <s5> in further fine mapping of the region, seven snps (rs8105790, rs11881222, rs8103142, rs28416813, rs4803219, rs8099917 and rs7248668) located in the il28b region showed the most significant associations (p = 5.52 × 10−28–2.68 × 10−32; or = 22.3–27.1). <s6> real-time quantitative pcr assays in peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed lower il28b expression levels in individuals carrying the minor alleles (p = 0.015).

lp+ss: Forkhead 0 (fox0) transcription factors are involved in cellular differentiation. <s0> cooperation among individuals is necessary for evolutionary transitions to higher levels of biological organization. <s1> in such transitions, groups of individuals at one level (such as single cells) cooperate to form selective units at a higher level (such as multicellular organisms). <s2> though the evolution of cooperation is difficult to observe directly in higher eukaryotes, microorganisms do offer such an opportunity. <s3> here we report the evolution of novel cooperative behaviour in experimental lineages of the bacterium myxococcus xanthus. <s4> wild-type strains of m. xanthus exhibit socially dependent swarming across soft surfaces by a mechanism known as 's-motility' that requires the presence of extracellular type iv pili. <s5> in lineages of m. xanthus unable to make pili, a new mechanistic basis for cooperative swarming evolved. <s6> evolved swarming is mediated, at least in part, by enhanced production of an extracellular fibril matrix that binds cells—and their evolutionary interests—together. <s7> though costly to individuals, fibril production greatly enhanced population expansion in groups of interconnected cells. <s8> these results show that fundamental transitions to primitive cooperation can readily occur in bacteria.

lp+ss: FoxO3a activation in neuronal death is inhibited by reactive oxygen species (ROS). <s0> the sir2 deacetylase modulates organismal life-span in various species. <s1> however, the molecular mechanisms by which sir2 increases longevity are largely unknown. <s2> we show that in mammalian cells, the sir2 homolog sirt1 appears to control the cellular response to stress by regulating the foxo family of forkhead transcription factors, a family of proteins that function as sensors of the insulin signaling pathway and as regulators of organismal longevity. <s3> sirt1 and the foxo transcription factor foxo3 formed a complex in cells in response to oxidative stress, and sirt1 deacetylated foxo3 in vitro and within cells. <s4> sirt1 had a dual effect on foxo3 function: sirt1 increased foxo3's ability to induce cell cycle arrest and resistance to oxidative stress but inhibited foxo3's ability to induce cell death. <s5> thus, one way in which members of the sir2 family of proteins may increase organismal longevity is by tipping foxo-dependent responses away from apoptosis and toward stress resistance.

lp+ss: Foxk2 regulates autophagy genes in muscle cells and fibroblast cells. <s0> autophagy is the primary catabolic process triggered in response to starvation. <s1> although autophagic regulation within the cytosolic compartment is well established, it is becoming clear that nuclear events also regulate the induction or repression of autophagy. <s2> nevertheless, a thorough understanding of the mechanisms by which sequence-specific transcription factors modulate expression of genes required for autophagy is lacking. <s3> here, we identify foxk proteins (foxk1 and foxk2) as transcriptional repressors of autophagy in muscle cells and fibroblasts. <s4> interestingly, foxk1/2 serve to counter-balance another forkhead transcription factor, foxo3, which induces an overlapping set of autophagic and atrophic targets in muscle. <s5> foxk1/2 specifically recruits sin3a-hdac complexes to restrict acetylation of histone h4 and expression of critical autophagy genes. <s6> remarkably, mtor promotes the transcriptional activity of foxk1 by facilitating nuclear entry to specifically limit basal levels of autophagy in nutrient-rich conditions. <s7> our study highlights an ancient, conserved mechanism whereby nutritional status is interpreted by mtor to restrict autophagy by repressing essential autophagy genes through foxk-sin3-mediated transcriptional control.

lp+ss: Gastric infection with Helicobacter pylori increases risk of gastric cancer in humans. <s0> wild-type p53 has recently been shown to repress transcription from several cellular and viral promoters. <s1> since p53 mutations are the most frequently reported genetic defects in human cancers, it becomes important to study the effects of mutations of p53 on promoter functions. <s2> we, therefore, have studied the effects of wild-type and mutant human p53 on the human proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (pcna) promoter and on several viral promoters, including the herpes simplex virus type 1 ul9 promoter, the human cytomegalovirus major immediate-early promoter-enhancer, and the long terminal repeat promoters of rous sarcoma virus and human t-cell lymphotropic virus type i. hela cells were cotransfected with a wild-type or mutant p53 expression vector and a plasmid containing a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene under viral (or cellular) promoter control. <s3> as expected, expression of the wild-type p53 inhibited promoter function. <s4> expression of a p53 with a mutation at any one of the four amino acid positions 175, 248, 273, or 281, however, correlated with a significant increase of the pcna promoter activity (2- to 11-fold). <s5> the viral promoters were also activated, although to a somewhat lesser extent. <s6> we also showed that activation by a mutant p53 requires a minimal promoter containing a lone tata box. <s7> a more significant increase (25-fold) in activation occurs when the promoter contains a binding site for the activating transcription factor or cyclic amp response element-binding protein. <s8> using saos-2 cells that do not express p53, we showed that activation by a mutant p53 was a direct enhancement. <s9> the mutant forms of p53 used in this study are found in various cancer cells. <s10> the activation of pcna by mutant p53s may indicate a way to increase cell proliferation by the mutant p53s. <s11> thus, our data indicate a possible functional role for the mutants of p53 found in cancer cells in activating several important loci, including pcna.

lp+ss: Genes involved in pre-mRNA splicing have a significant impact on genome stability. <s0> signaling pathways that respond to dna damage are essential for the maintenance of genome stability and are linked to many diseases, including cancer. <s1> here, a genome-wide sirna screen was employed to identify additional genes involved in genome stabilization by monitoring phosphorylation of the histone variant h2ax, an early mark of dna damage. <s2> we identified hundreds of genes whose downregulation led to elevated levels of h2ax phosphorylation (gammah2ax) and revealed links to cellular complexes and to genes with unclassified functions. <s3> we demonstrate a widespread role for mrna-processing factors in preventing dna damage, which in some cases is caused by aberrant rna-dna structures. <s4> furthermore, we connect increased gammah2ax levels to the neurological disorder charcot-marie-tooth (cmt) syndrome, and we find a role for several cmt proteins in the dna-damage response. <s5> these data indicate that preservation of genome stability is mediated by a larger network of biological processes than previously appreciated.

lp+ss: Genes involved in pre-mRNA splicing have a significant impact on genome stability. <s0> computer techniques readily extract from the brainwaves an orderly sequence of brain potentials locked in time to sound stimuli. <s1> the potentials that appear 8 to 80 msec after the stimulus resemble 3 or 4 cycles of a 40-hz sine wave; we show here that these waves combined to form a single, stable, composite wave when the sounds are repeated at rates around 40 per sec. this phenomenon, the 40-hz event-related potential (erp), displays several properties of theoretical and practical interest. <s2> first, it reportedly disappears with surgical anesthesia, and it resembles similar phenomena in the visual and olfactory system, facts which suggest that adequate processing of sensory information may require cyclical brain events in the 30- to 50-hz range. <s3> second, latency and amplitude measurements on the 40-hz erp indicate it may contain useful information on the number and basilar membrane location of the auditory nerve fibers a given tone excites. <s4> third, the response is present at sound intensities very close to normal adult thresholds for the audiometric frequencies, a fact that could have application in clinical hearing testing. 
lp+ss: Genes regulated by Esrrb transcription factor are sensitive to Mbd3 function. <s0> the ontogeny of haematopoietic stem cells (hscs) during embryonic development is still highly debated, especially their possible lineage relationship to vascular endothelial cells. <s1> the first anatomical site from which cells with long-term hsc potential have been isolated is the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (agm), more specifically the vicinity of the dorsal aortic floor. <s2> but although some authors have presented evidence that hscs may arise directly from the aortic floor into the dorsal aortic lumen, others support the notion that hscs first emerge within the underlying mesenchyme. <s3> here we show by non-invasive, high-resolution imaging of live zebrafish embryos, that hscs emerge directly from the aortic floor, through a stereotyped process that does not involve cell division but a strong bending then egress of single endothelial cells from the aortic ventral wall into the sub-aortic space, and their concomitant transformation into haematopoietic cells. <s4> the process is polarized not only in the dorso-ventral but also in the rostro-caudal versus medio-lateral direction, and depends on runx1 expression: in runx1-deficient embryos, the exit events are initially similar, but much rarer, and abort into violent death of the exiting cell. <s5> these results demonstrate that the aortic floor is haemogenic and that hscs emerge from it into the sub-aortic space, not by asymmetric cell division but through a new type of cell behaviour, which we call an endothelial haematopoietic transition. 
lp+ss: Genes regulated by Esrrb transcription factor are sensitive to Mbd3 function. <s0> transcription factors, such as oct4, are critical for establishing and maintaining pluripotent cell identity. <s1> whereas the genomic locations of several pluripotency transcription factors have been reported, the spectrum of their interaction partners is underexplored. <s2> here, we use an improved affinity protocol to purify oct4-interacting proteins from mouse embryonic stem cells (escs). <s3> subsequent purification of oct4 partners sall4, tcfcp2l1, dax1, and esrrb resulted in an oct4 interactome of 166 proteins, including transcription factors and chromatin-modifying complexes with documented roles in self-renewal, but also many factors not previously associated with the esc network. <s4> we find that esrrb associated with the basal transcription machinery and also detect interactions between transcription factors and components of the tgf-beta, notch, and wnt signaling pathways. <s5> acute depletion of oct4 reduced binding of tcfcp2l1, dax1, and esrrb to several target genes. <s6> in conclusion, our purification protocol allowed us to bring greater definition to the circuitry controlling pluripotent cell identity. 
lp+ss: Genetic deficiency of mast cells leads to decreased weight gain in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity. <s0> although mast cell functions have classically been related to allergic responses, recent studies indicate that these cells contribute to other common diseases such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, aortic aneurysm and cancer. <s1> this study presents evidence that mast cells also contribute to diet-induced obesity and diabetes. <s2> for example, white adipose tissue (wat) from obese humans and mice contain more mast cells than wat from their lean counterparts. <s3> furthermore, in the context of mice on a western diet, genetically induced deficiency of mast cells, or their pharmacological stabilization, reduces body weight gain and levels of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and proteases in serum and wat, in concert with improved glucose homeostasis and energy expenditure. <s4> mechanistic studies reveal that mast cells contribute to wat and muscle angiogenesis and associated cell apoptosis and cathepsin activity. <s5> adoptive transfer experiments of cytokine-deficient mast cells show that these cells, by producing interleukin-6 (il-6) and interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma), contribute to mouse adipose tissue cysteine protease cathepsin expression, apoptosis and angiogenesis, thereby promoting diet-induced obesity and glucose intolerance. <s6> our results showing reduced obesity and diabetes in mice treated with clinically available mast cell-stabilizing agents suggest the potential of developing new therapies for these common human metabolic disorders.

lp+ss: Genomic aberrations of metastases provide information for targeted therapy. <s0> human tumors show a high level of genetic heterogeneity, but the processes that influence the timing and route of metastatic dissemination of the subclones are unknown. <s1> here we have used whole-exome sequencing of 103 matched benign, malignant and metastatic skin tumors from genetically heterogeneous mice to demonstrate that most metastases disseminate synchronously from the primary tumor, supporting parallel rather than linear evolution as the predominant model of metastasis. <s2> shared mutations between primary carcinomas and their matched metastases have the distinct a-to-t signature of the initiating carcinogen dimethylbenzanthracene, but non-shared mutations are primarily g-to-t, a signature associated with oxidative stress. <s3> the existence of carcinomas that either did or did not metastasize in the same host animal suggests that there are tumor-intrinsic factors that influence metastatic seeding. <s4> we also demonstrate the importance of germline polymorphisms in determining allele-specific mutations, and we identify somatic genetic alterations that are specifically related to initiation of carcinogenesis by hras or kras mutations. <s5> mouse tumors that mimic the genetic heterogeneity of human cancers can aid our understanding of the clonal evolution of metastasis and provide a realistic model for the testing of novel therapies.

lp+ss: Genomic aberrations of metastases provide information for targeted therapy. <s0> the angiopoietin-tie2 system in endothelial cells is an important regulator of vasculogenesis and vascular integrity. <s1> high levels of angiopoietin-2 (ang2) mrna are observed in vascular activation during tumorigenesis. <s2> although ang2 is known to be a naturally occurring antagonist of angiopoietin-1 (ang1) in vivo, the exact function of ang2 itself is not known. <s3> here, we found that a high concentration of ang2 (800 ng/ml) acts as an apoptosis survival factor for endothelial cells during serum deprivation apoptosis. <s4> the survival effect of high concentration ang2 was blocked by pre-treatment with soluble tie2 receptor and the pi 3′-kinase-specific inhibitors, wortmannin and ly294002. <s5> accordingly, 800 ng/ml of ang2 induced phosphorylation of tie2, the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (pi 3′-kinase), and serine-threonine kinase akt at ser473 in the human umbilical vein endothelial cells; lower concentrations of ang2 (50–400 ng/ml) did not produce notable effects. <s6> these findings indicate that at high concentrations, ang2, like ang1, can be an apoptosis survival factor for endothelial cells through the activation of the tie2 receptor, pi 3′-kinase and akt, and thus may be a positive regulator of tumor angiogenesis. 
lp+ss: Genomic sequences involved in alternative splicing responsible for Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) are abundant in the ''progerinonly'' allele of Lmna knock-in models. <s0> hutchinson-gilford progeria syndrome (hgps) is a childhood premature aging disease caused by a spontaneous point mutation in lamin a (encoded by lmna), one of the major architectural elements of the mammalian cell nucleus. <s1> the hgps mutation activates an aberrant cryptic splice site in lmna pre-mrna, leading to synthesis of a truncated lamin a protein and concomitant reduction in wild-type lamin a. fibroblasts from individuals with hgps have severe morphological abnormalities in nuclear envelope structure. <s2> here we show that the cellular disease phenotype is reversible in cells from individuals with hgps. <s3> introduction of wild-type lamin a protein does not rescue the cellular disease symptoms. <s4> the mutant lmna mrna and lamin a protein can be efficiently eliminated by correction of the aberrant splicing event using a modified oligonucleotide targeted to the activated cryptic splice site. <s5> upon splicing correction, hgps fibroblasts assume normal nuclear morphology, the aberrant nuclear distribution and cellular levels of lamina-associated proteins are rescued, defects in heterochromatin-specific histone modifications are corrected and proper expression of several misregulated genes is reestablished. <s6> our results establish proof of principle for the correction of the premature aging phenotype in individuals with hgps.

lp+ss: Genomic sequences involved in alternative splicing responsible for Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) are abundant in the ''progerinonly'' allele of Lmna knock-in models. <s0> background cellular nucleic acid binding protein (cnbp) has been implicated in vertebrate craniofacial development and in myotonic dystrophy type 2 (dm2) and sporadic inclusion body myositis (sibm) human diseases by controlling cell proliferation and survival to mediate neural crest expansion. <s1> cnbp has been found to bind single-stranded nucleic acid and promote rearrangements of nucleic acid secondary structure in an atp-independent manner, acting as a nucleic acid chaperone.  <s2> methods a variety of methods were used, including cell viability assays, wound-scratch assays, chemotaxis assays, invasion assays, circular dichroic (cd) spectroscopy, nmr spectroscopy, chromatin immunoprecipitation, expression and purification of recombinant human cnbp, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (emsa), surface plasmon resonance (spr), fluorescence resonance energy transfer (fret) analyses, luciferase reporter assay, western blotting, and isothermal titration calorimetry (itc).  <s3> results up-regulation of cnbp induced human fibrosarcoma cell death and suppressed fibrosarcoma cell motility and invasiveness. <s4> it was found that cnbp transcriptionally down-regulated the expression of heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein k (hnrnp k) through its conversion of a g-rich sequence into g-quadruplex in the promoter of hnrnp k. g-quadruplex stabilizing ligand tetra-(n-methyl-4-pyridyl) porphyrin (tmpyp4) could interact with and stabilize the g-quadruplex, resulting in downregulation of hnrnp k transcription.  <s5> conclusions cnbp overexpression caused increase of cell death and suppression of cell metastasis through its induction of g-quadruplex formation in the promoter of hnrnp k resulting in hnrnp k down-regulation.    <s6> general significance the present result provided a new solution for controlling hnrnp k expression, which should shed light on new anticancer drug design and development.

lp+ss: Glial calcium waves influence seizures. <s0> seizures in focal epilepsies are sustained by a highly synchronous neuronal discharge that arises at restricted brain sites and subsequently spreads to large portions of the brain. <s1> despite intense experimental research in this field, the earlier cellular events that initiate and sustain a focal seizure are still not well defined. <s2> their identification is central to understand the pathophysiology of focal epilepsies and to develop new pharmacological therapies for drug-resistant forms of epilepsy. <s3> the prominent involvement of astrocytes in ictogenesis was recently proposed. <s4> we test here whether a cooperation between astrocytes and neurons is a prerequisite to support ictal (seizure-like) and interictal epileptiform events. <s5> simultaneous patch-clamp recording and ca2+ imaging techniques were performed in a new in vitro model of focal seizures induced by local applications of n-methyl-d-aspartic acid (nmda) in rat entorhinal cortex slices. <s6> we found that a ca2+ elevation in astrocytes correlates with both the initial development and the maintenance of a focal, seizure-like discharge. <s7> a delayed astrocyte activation during ictal discharges was also observed in other models (including the whole in vitro isolated guinea pig brain) in which the site of generation of seizure activity cannot be precisely monitored. <s8> in contrast, interictal discharges were not associated with ca2+ changes in astrocytes. <s9> selective inhibition or stimulation of astrocyte ca2+ signalling blocked or enhanced, respectively, ictal discharges, but did not affect interictal discharge generation. <s10> our data reveal that neurons engage astrocytes in a recurrent excitatory loop (possibly involving gliotransmission) that promotes seizure ignition and sustains the ictal discharge. <s11> this neuron-astrocyte interaction may represent a novel target to develop effective therapeutic strategies to control seizures.

lp+ss: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is characterized by extensive invasion, rapid growth, necrosis, and angiogenesis. <s0> proteasomes are cylindrical structures that function in multiple cellular processes by degrading a wide variety of cytosolic and nuclear proteins. <s1> substrate access and product release from the enclosed catalytic chamber occurs through axial pores that are opened by activator complexes. <s2> here, we report high-resolution structures of wild-type and mutant archaeal proteasomes bound to the activator pa26. <s3> these structures support the proposal that an ordered open conformation is required for proteolysis and that its formation can be triggered by outward displacement of surrounding residues. <s4> the structures and associated biochemical assays reveal the mechanism of binding, which involves an interaction between the pa26 c terminus and a conserved lysine. <s5> surprisingly, biochemical observations implicate an equivalent interaction for the unrelated atp-dependent activators pan and pa700. 
lp+ss: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is characterized by extensive invasion, rapid growth, necrosis, and angiogenesis. <s0> the microrna (mirna) "sponge" method was introduced three years ago as a means to create continuous mirna loss of function in cell lines and transgenic organisms. <s1> sponge rnas contain complementary binding sites to a mirna of interest, and are produced from transgenes within cells. <s2> as with most mirna target genes, a sponge's binding sites are specific to the mirna seed region, which allows them to block a whole family of related mirnas. <s3> this transgenic approach has proven to be a useful tool to probe mirna functions in a variety of experimental systems. <s4> here we will discuss the ways sponge and related constructs can be optimized and review recent applications of this method with particular emphasis on stable expression in cancer studies and in transgenic animals. 
lp+ss: Glucose restriction to 0.05% reduces RLS (replicative life span) by 20-40% in S. cerevisiae. <s0> calorie restriction slows aging and increases life span in many organisms. <s1> in yeast, a mechanistic explanation has been proposed whereby calorie restriction slows aging by activating sir2. <s2> here we report the identification of a sir2-independent pathway responsible for a majority of the longevity benefit associated with calorie restriction. <s3> deletion of fob1 and overexpression of sir2 have been previously found to increase life span by reducing the levels of toxic rdna circles in aged mother cells. <s4> we find that combining calorie restriction with either of these genetic interventions dramatically enhances longevity, resulting in the longest-lived yeast strain reported thus far. <s5> further, calorie restriction results in a greater life span extension in cells lacking both sir2 and fob1 than in cells where sir2 is present. <s6> these findings indicate that sir2 and calorie restriction act in parallel pathways to promote longevity in yeast and, perhaps, higher eukaryotes. 
lp+ss: Glycan adaptation is rarely observed in the B-cell repertoire. <s0> broadly neutralizing antibodies against highly variable viral pathogens are much sought after to treat or protect against global circulating viruses. <s1> here we probed the neutralizing antibody repertoires of four human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-infected donors with remarkably broad and potent neutralizing responses and rescued 17 new monoclonal antibodies that neutralize broadly across clades. <s2> many of the new monoclonal antibodies are almost tenfold more potent than the recently described pg9, pg16 and vrc01 broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and 100-fold more potent than the original prototype hiv broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. <s3> the monoclonal antibodies largely recapitulate the neutralization breadth found in the corresponding donor serum and many recognize novel epitopes on envelope (env) glycoprotein gp120, illuminating new targets for vaccine design. <s4> analysis of neutralization by the full complement of anti-hiv broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies now available reveals that certain combinations of antibodies should offer markedly more favourable coverage of the enormous diversity of global circulating viruses than others and these combinations might be sought in active or passive immunization regimes. <s5> overall, the isolation of multiple hiv broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from several donors that, in aggregate, provide broad coverage at low concentrations is a highly positive indicator for the eventual design of an effective antibody-based hiv vaccine. 
lp+ss: Glycan adaptation is rarely observed in the B-cell repertoire. <s0> cd4 t cell help is critical for the generation and maintenance of germinal centers (gcs), and t follicular helper (t(fh)) cells are the cd4 t cell subset required for this process. <s1> signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (slam)-associated protein (sap [sh2d1a]) expression in cd4 t cells is essential for gc development. <s2> however, sap-deficient mice have only a moderate defect in t(fh) differentiation, as defined by common t(fh) surface markers. <s3> cxcr5(+) t(fh) cells are found within the gc, as well as along the boundary regions of t/b cell zones. <s4> in this study, we show that gc-associated t follicular helper (gc t(fh)) cells can be identified by their coexpression of cxcr5 and the gl7 epitope, allowing for phenotypic and functional analysis of t(fh) and gc t(fh) populations. <s5> gc t(fh) cells are a functionally discrete subset of further polarized t(fh) cells, with enhanced b cell help capacity and a specialized ability to produce il-4 in a t(h)2-independent manner. <s6> strikingly, sap-deficient mice have an absence of the gc t(fh) cell subset and sap(-) t(fh) cells are defective in il-4 and il-21 production. <s7> we further demonstrate that slam (slamf1, cd150), a surface receptor that uses sap signaling, is specifically required for il-4 production by gc t(fh) cells. <s8> gc t(fh) cells require il-4 and -21 production for optimal help to b cells. <s9> these data illustrate complexities of sap-dependent slam family receptor signaling, revealing a prominent role for slam receptor ligation in il-4 production by gc cd4 t cells but not in t(fh) cell and gc t(fh) cell differentiation.

lp+ss: Gpr124 suppresses BBB breakdown in mouse models of ischemic stroke. <s0> it has been estimated that approximately 37% of the us population judged to be at high risk for developing coronary artery disease (cad), based on the national cholesterol education program guidelines, have increased plasma lipoprotein(a) [lp(a)], whereas lp(a) is increased in only 14% of those judged to be at low risk. <s1> therefore, the importance of establishing a better understanding of the relative contribution of lp(a) to the risk burden for cad and other forms of vascular disease, as well as the underlying mechanisms, is clearly evident. <s2> however, the structural complexity and size heterogeneity of lp(a) have hindered the development of immunoassays to accurately measure lp(a) concentrations in plasma. <s3> the large intermethod variation in lp(a) values has made it difficult to compare data from different clinical studies and to achieve a uniform interpretation of clinical data. <s4> a workshop was recently convened by the national heart, lung, and blood institute (nhlbi) to evaluate our current understanding of lp(a) as a risk factor for atherosclerotic disorders; to determine how future studies could be designed to more clearly define the extent to which, and mechanisms by which, lp(a) participates in these processes; and to present the results of the nhlbi-supported program for the evaluation and standardization of lp(a) immunoassays. <s5> this report includes the most recent data presented by the workshop participants and the resulting practical and research recommendations. 
lp+ss: Guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (Rho-GDI) interacts with the p75 NTR death domain <s0> the myc oncogene regulates the expression of several components of the protein synthetic machinery, including ribosomal proteins, initiation factors of translation, rna polymerase iii and ribosomal dna. <s1> whether and how increasing the cellular protein synthesis capacity affects the multistep process leading to cancer remains to be addressed. <s2> here we use ribosomal protein heterozygote mice as a genetic tool to restore increased protein synthesis in emu-myc/+ transgenic mice to normal levels, and show that the oncogenic potential of myc in this context is suppressed. <s3> our findings demonstrate that the ability of myc to increase protein synthesis directly augments cell size and is sufficient to accelerate cell cycle progression independently of known cell cycle targets transcriptionally regulated by myc. <s4> in addition, when protein synthesis is restored to normal levels, myc-overexpressing precancerous cells are more efficiently eliminated by programmed cell death. <s5> our findings reveal a new mechanism that links increases in general protein synthesis rates downstream of an oncogenic signal to a specific molecular impairment in the modality of translation initiation used to regulate the expression of selective messenger rnas. <s6> we show that an aberrant increase in cap-dependent translation downstream of myc hyperactivation specifically impairs the translational switch to internal ribosomal entry site (ires)-dependent translation that is required for accurate mitotic progression. <s7> failure of this translational switch results in reduced mitotic-specific expression of the endogenous ires-dependent form of cdk11 (also known as cdc2l and pitslre), which leads to cytokinesis defects and is associated with increased centrosome numbers and genome instability in emu-myc/+ mice. <s8> when accurate translational control is re-established in emu-myc/+ mice, genome instability is suppressed. <s9> our findings demonstrate how perturbations in translational control provide a highly specific outcome for gene expression, genome stability and cancer initiation that have important implications for understanding the molecular mechanism of cancer formation at the post-genomic level. 
lp+ss: Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) mediate RhoA activation in response to tensional forces on fibronectin-binding integrins. <s0> how individual cells respond to mechanical forces is of considerable interest to biologists as force affects many aspects of cell behaviour. <s1> the application of force on integrins triggers cytoskeletal rearrangements and growth of the associated adhesion complex, resulting in increased cellular stiffness, also known as reinforcement. <s2> although rhoa has been shown to play a role during reinforcement, the molecular mechanisms that regulate its activity are unknown. <s3> by combining biochemical and biophysical approaches, we identified two guanine nucleotide exchange factors (gefs), larg and gef-h1, as key molecules that regulate the cellular adaptation to force. <s4> we show that stimulation of integrins with tensional force triggers activation of these two gefs and their recruitment to adhesion complexes. <s5> surprisingly, activation of larg and gef-h1 involves distinct signalling pathways. <s6> our results reveal that larg is activated by the src family tyrosine kinase fyn, whereas gef-h1 catalytic activity is enhanced by erk downstream of a signalling cascade that includes fak and ras.

lp+ss: Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) mediate RhoA activation in response to tensional forces on fibronectin-binding integrins. <s0> p53 is a crucial tumour suppressor that responds to diverse stress signals by orchestrating specific cellular responses, including transient cell cycle arrest, cellular senescence and apoptosis, which are all processes associated with tumour suppression. <s1> however, recent studies have challenged the relative importance of these canonical cellular responses for p53-mediated tumour suppression and have highlighted roles for p53 in modulating other cellular processes, including metabolism, stem cell maintenance, invasion and metastasis, as well as communication within the tumour microenvironment. <s2> in this opinion article, we discuss the roles of classical p53 functions, as well as emerging p53-regulated processes, in tumour suppression. 
lp+ss: H.pylori-mediated gastric cancer occurs due to the accumulation of mutations in host epithelial cells. <s0> infection with helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) is a risk factor for the development of gastric cancer. <s1> here we show that infection of gastric epithelial cells with 'cag' pathogenicity island (cagpai)-positive h. pylori induced aberrant expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (aid), a member of the cytidine-deaminase family that acts as a dna- and rna-editing enzyme, via the iκb kinase–dependent nuclear factor-κb activation pathway. <s2> h. pylori–mediated upregulation of aid resulted in the accumulation of nucleotide alterations in the tp53 tumor suppressor gene in gastric cells in vitro. <s3> our findings provide evidence that aberrant aid expression caused by h. pylori infection might be a mechanism of mutation accumulation in the gastric mucosa during h. pylori–associated gastric carcinogenesis.

lp+ss: H.pylori-mediated gastric cancer occurs due to the accumulation of mutations in host epithelial cells. <s0> glioblastoma multiforme (gbm) is a fatal malignancy of the central nervous system, commonly associated with chemoresistance. <s1> the alkylating agent temozolomide (tmz) is the front-line chemotherapeutic agent and has undergone intense studies on resistance. <s2> these studies reported on mismatch repair gene upregulation, abc-targeted drug efflux, and cell cycle alterations. <s3> the mechanism by which tmz induces cell cycle arrest has not been well-established. <s4> tmz-resistant gbm cells have been linked to microrna (mirna) and exosomes. <s5> a cell cycle mirna array identified distinct mirnas only in exosomes from tmz-resistant gbm cell lines and primary spheres. <s6> we narrowed the mirs to mir-93 and -193 and showed in computational analyses that they could target cyclin d1. <s7> since cyclin d1 is a major regulator of cell cycle progression, we performed cause-effect studies and showed a blunting effects of mir-93 and -193 in cyclin d1 expression. <s8> these two mirs also decreased cell cycling quiescence and induced resistance to tmz. <s9> taken together, our data provide a mechanism by which gbm cells can exhibit tmz-induced resistance through mirna targeting of cyclin d1. <s10> the data provide a number of therapeutic approaches to reverse chemoresistance at the mirna, exosomal and cell cycle points. 
lp+ss: H.pylori-mediated gastric cancer occurs due to the accumulation of mutations in host epithelial cells. <s0> despite progress in the development of drugs that efficiently target cancer cells, treatments for metastatic tumours are often ineffective. <s1> the now well-established dependency of cancer cells on their microenvironment suggests that targeting the non-cancer-cell component of the tumour might form a basis for the development of novel therapeutic approaches. <s2> however, the as-yet poorly characterized contribution of host responses during tumour growth and metastatic progression represents a limitation to exploiting this approach. <s3> here we identify neutrophils as the main component and driver of metastatic establishment within the (pre-)metastatic lung microenvironment in mouse breast cancer models. <s4> neutrophils have a fundamental role in inflammatory responses and their contribution to tumorigenesis is still controversial. <s5> using various strategies to block neutrophil recruitment to the pre-metastatic site, we demonstrate that neutrophils specifically support metastatic initiation. <s6> importantly, we find that neutrophil-derived leukotrienes aid the colonization of distant tissues by selectively expanding the sub-pool of cancer cells that retain high tumorigenic potential. <s7> genetic or pharmacological inhibition of the leukotriene-generating enzyme arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (alox5) abrogates neutrophil pro-metastatic activity and consequently reduces metastasis. <s8> our results reveal the efficacy of using targeted therapy against a specific tumour microenvironment component and indicate that neutrophil alox5 inhibition may limit metastatic progression. 
lp+ss: H4 G94P proteins induce chromatin assembly, which increases free histones. <s0> histone levels are tightly regulated to prevent harmful effects such as genomic instability and hypersensitivity to dna-damaging agents due to the accumulation of these highly basic proteins when dna replication slows down or stops. <s1> although chromosomal histones are stable, excess (non-chromatin bound) histones are rapidly degraded in a rad53 (radiation sensitive 53) kinase-dependent manner in saccharomyces cerevisiae. <s2> here we demonstrate that excess histones associate with rad53 in vivo and seem to undergo modifications such as tyrosine phosphorylation and polyubiquitylation, before their proteolysis by the proteasome. <s3> we have identified the tyr 99 residue of histone h3 as being critical for the efficient ubiquitylation and degradation of this histone. <s4> we have also identified the ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (e2) ubc4 and ubc5, as well as the ubiquitin ligase (e3) tom1 (temperature dependent organization in mitotic nucleus 1), as enzymes involved in the ubiquitylation of excess histones. <s5> regulated histone proteolysis has major implications for the maintenance of epigenetic marks on chromatin, genomic stability and the packaging of sperm dna. 
lp+ss: H4 G94P proteins induce chromatin assembly, which increases free histones. <s0> integrins are membrane receptors which mediate cell-cell or cell-matrix adhesion. <s1> integrin alpha iib beta 3 (glycoprotein iib-iiia) acts as a fibrinogen receptor of platelets and mediates platelet aggregation. <s2> platelet activation is required for alpha iib beta 3 to shift from noncompetent to competent for binding soluble fibrinogen. <s3> the steps involved in this transition are poorly understood. <s4> we have studied a variant of glanzmann thrombasthenia, a congenital bleeding disorder characterized by absence of platelet aggregation and fibrinogen binding. <s5> the patient's platelets did not bind fibrinogen after platelet activation by adp or thrombin, though his platelets contained alpha iib beta 3. <s6> however, isolated alpha iib beta 3 was able to bind to an arg-gly-asp-ser affinity column, and binding of soluble fibrinogen to the patient's platelets could be triggered by modulators of alpha iib beta 3 conformation such as the arg-gly-asp-ser peptide and alpha-chymotrypsin. <s7> these data suggested that a functional arg-gly-asp binding site was present within alpha iib beta 3 and that the patient's defect was not secondary to a blockade of alpha iib beta 3 in a noncompetent conformational state. <s8> this was evocative of a defect in the coupling between platelet activation and alpha iib beta 3 up-regulation. <s9> we therefore sequenced the cytoplasmic domain of beta 3, following polymerase chain reaction (pcr) on platelet rna, and found a t->c mutation at nucleotide 2259, corresponding to a ser-752->pro substitution. <s10> this mutation is likely to be responsible for the uncoupling of alpha iib beta 3 from cellular activation because (i) it is not a polymorphism, (ii) it is the only mutation in the entire alpha iib beta 3 sequence, and (iii) genetic analysis of the family showed that absence of the pro-752 beta 3 allele was associated with the normal phenotype. <s11> our data thus identify the c-terminal portion of the cytoplasmic domain of beta 3 as an intrinsic element in the coupling between alpha iib beta 3 and platelet activation. 
lp+ss: H4 G94P proteins induce degradation of free histones via Rad53-dependent mechanisms. <s0> in birds and mammals, cardiac neural crest is essential for heart development and contributes to conotruncal cushion formation and outflow tract septation. <s1> the zebrafish prototypical heart lacks outflow tract septation, raising the question of whether cardiac neural crest exists in zebrafish. <s2> here, results from three distinct lineage-labeling approaches identify zebrafish cardiac neural crest cells and indicate that these cells have the ability to generate mf20-positive muscle cells in the myocardium of the major chambers during development. <s3> fate-mapping demonstrates that cardiac neural crest cells originate both from neural tube regions analogous to those found in birds, as well as from a novel region rostral to the otic vesicle. <s4> in contrast to other vertebrates, cardiac neural crest invades the myocardium in all segments of the heart, including outflow tract, atrium, atrioventricular junction, and ventricle in zebrafish. <s5> three distinct groups of premigratory neural crest along the rostrocaudal axis have different propensities to contribute to different segments in the heart and are correspondingly marked by unique combinations of gene expression patterns. <s6> zebrafish will serve as a model for understanding interactions between cardiac neural crest and cardiovascular development. 
lp+ss: H4 G94P proteins inhibit chromatin assembly, which decreases free histones. <s0> the balance between excitatory and inhibitory synapses is crucial for normal brain function. <s1> wnt proteins stimulate synapse formation by increasing synaptic assembly. <s2> however, it is unclear whether wnt signaling differentially regulates the formation of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. <s3> here, we demonstrate that wnt7a preferentially stimulates excitatory synapse formation and function. <s4> in hippocampal neurons, wnt7a increases the number of excitatory synapses, whereas inhibitory synapses are unaffected. <s5> wnt7a or postsynaptic expression of dishevelled-1 (dvl1), a core wnt signaling component, increases the frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mepscs), but not miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mipscs). <s6> wnt7a increases the density and maturity of dendritic spines, whereas wnt7a-dvl1-deficient mice exhibit defects in spine morphogenesis and mossy fiber-ca3 synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. <s7> using a postsynaptic reporter for ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii (camkii) activity, we demonstrate that wnt7a rapidly activates camkii in spines. <s8> importantly, camkii inhibition abolishes the effects of wnt7a on spine growth and excitatory synaptic strength. <s9> these data indicate that wnt7a signaling is critical to regulate spine growth and synaptic strength through the local activation of camkii at dendritic spines. <s10> therefore, aberrant wnt7a signaling may contribute to neurological disorders in which excitatory signaling is disrupted. 
lp+ss: H4 G94P proteins inhibit chromatin assembly, which decreases free histones. <s0> background the prevalence of diabetes is increasing in all industrialized countries and its prevention has become a public health priority. <s1> however, the predictors of diabetes risk are insufficiently understood. <s2> we evaluated, whether 31 novel biomarkers could help to predict the risk of incident diabetes.  <s3> methods and findings the biomarkers were evaluated primarily in the finrisk97 cohort (n = 7,827; 417 cases of clinically incident diabetes during the follow-up). <s4> the findings were replicated in the health 2000 cohort (n = 4,977; 179 cases of clinically incident diabetes during the follow-up). <s5> we used cox proportional hazards models to calculate the relative risk of diabetes, after adjusting for the classic risk factors, separately for each biomarker. <s6> next, we assessed the discriminatory ability of single biomarkers using receiver operating characteristic curves and c-statistics, integrated discrimination improvement (idi) and net reclassification improvement (nri). <s7> finally, we derived a biomarker score in the finrisk97 cohort and validated it in the health 2000 cohort. <s8> a score consisting of adiponectin, apolipoprotein b, c-reactive protein and ferritin almost doubled the relative risk of diabetes in the validation cohort (hr per one standard deviation increase 1.88, p = 2.8 e-5). <s9> it also improved discrimination of the model (idi = 0.0149, p<0.0001) and reclassification of diabetes risk (nri = 11.8%, p = 0.006). <s10> gender-specific analyses suggested that the best score differed between men and women. <s11> among men, the best results were obtained with the score of four biomarkers: adiponectin, apolipoprotein b, ferritin and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, which gave an nri of 25.4% (p<0.0001). <s12> among women, the best score included adiponectin, apolipoprotein b, c-reactive protein and insulin. <s13> it gave an nri of 13.6% (p = 0.041).  <s14> conclusions we identified novel biomarkers that were associated with the risk of clinically incident diabetes over and above the classic risk factors. <s15> this gives new insights into the pathogenesis of diabetes and may help with targeting prevention and treatment. 
lp+ss: H4 G94P proteins inhibit chromatin assembly, which decreases free histones. <s0> histone levels are tightly regulated to prevent harmful effects such as genomic instability and hypersensitivity to dna-damaging agents due to the accumulation of these highly basic proteins when dna replication slows down or stops. <s1> although chromosomal histones are stable, excess (non-chromatin bound) histones are rapidly degraded in a rad53 (radiation sensitive 53) kinase-dependent manner in saccharomyces cerevisiae. <s2> here we demonstrate that excess histones associate with rad53 in vivo and seem to undergo modifications such as tyrosine phosphorylation and polyubiquitylation, before their proteolysis by the proteasome. <s3> we have identified the tyr 99 residue of histone h3 as being critical for the efficient ubiquitylation and degradation of this histone. <s4> we have also identified the ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (e2) ubc4 and ubc5, as well as the ubiquitin ligase (e3) tom1 (temperature dependent organization in mitotic nucleus 1), as enzymes involved in the ubiquitylation of excess histones. <s5> regulated histone proteolysis has major implications for the maintenance of epigenetic marks on chromatin, genomic stability and the packaging of sperm dna. 
lp+ss: H4 G94P proteins suppress degradation of free histones via Rad53-dependent mechanisms. <s0> after infection and a prolonged incubation period, the scrapie agent causes a degenerative disease of the central nervous system in sheep and goats. <s1> six lines of evidence including sensitivity to proteases demonstrate that this agent contains a protein that is required for infectivity. <s2> although the scrapie agent is irreversibly inactivated by alkali, five procedures with more specificity for modifying nucleic acids failed to cause inactivation. <s3> the agent shows heterogeneity with respect to size, apparently a result of its hydrophobicity; the smallest form may have a molecular weight of 50,000 or less. <s4> because the novel properties of the scrapie agent distinguish it from viruses, plasmids, and viroids, a new term "prion" is proposed to denote a small proteinaceous infectious particle which is resistant to inactivation by most procedures that modify nucleic acids. <s5> knowledge of the scrapie agent structure may have significance for understanding the causes of several degenerative diseases. 
lp+ss: HAND2 methylation is a key step in early endometrial carcinogenesis. <s0> background endometrial cancer incidence is continuing to rise in the wake of the current ageing and obesity epidemics. <s1> much of the risk for endometrial cancer development is influenced by the environment and lifestyle. <s2> accumulating evidence suggests that the epigenome serves as the interface between the genome and the environment and that hypermethylation of stem cell polycomb group target genes is an epigenetic hallmark of cancer. <s3> the objective of this study was to determine the functional role of epigenetic factors in endometrial cancer development.  <s4> methods and findings epigenome-wide methylation analysis of >27,000 cpg sites in endometrial cancer tissue samples (n = 64) and control samples (n = 23) revealed that hand2 (a gene encoding a transcription factor expressed in the endometrial stroma) is one of the most commonly hypermethylated and silenced genes in endometrial cancer. <s5> a novel integrative epigenome-transcriptome-interactome analysis further revealed that hand2 is the hub of the most highly ranked differential methylation hotspot in endometrial cancer. <s6> these findings were validated using candidate gene methylation analysis in multiple clinical sample sets of tissue samples from a total of 272 additional women. <s7> increased hand2 methylation was a feature of premalignant endometrial lesions and was seen to parallel a decrease in rna and protein levels. <s8> furthermore, women with high endometrial hand2 methylation in their premalignant lesions were less likely to respond to progesterone treatment. <s9> hand2 methylation analysis of endometrial secretions collected using high vaginal swabs taken from women with postmenopausal bleeding specifically identified those patients with early stage endometrial cancer with both high sensitivity and high specificity (receiver operating characteristics area under the curve = 0.91 for stage 1a and 0.97 for higher than stage 1a). <s10> finally, mice harbouring a hand2 knock-out specifically in their endometrium were shown to develop precancerous endometrial lesions with increasing age, and these lesions also demonstrated a lack of pten expression.  <s11> conclusions hand2 methylation is a common and crucial molecular alteration in endometrial cancer that could potentially be employed as a biomarker for early detection of endometrial cancer and as a predictor of treatment response. <s12> the true clinical utility of hand2 dna methylation, however, requires further validation in prospective studies. <s13> please see later in the article for the editors' summary.

lp+ss: HIV trans-activator protein (TAT) effectively transports large and small molecules across cellular membranes into larger populations of neurons. <s0> down syndrome (trisomy 21) is the most common viable chromosomal disorder with intellectual impairment and several other developmental abnormalities. <s1> here, we report the generation and characterization of induced pluripotent stem cells (ipscs) derived from monozygotic twins discordant for trisomy 21 in order to eliminate the effects of the variability of genomic background. <s2> the alterations observed by genetic analysis at the ipsc level and at first approximation in early development illustrate the developmental disease transcriptional signature of down syndrome. <s3> moreover, we observed an abnormal neural differentiation of down syndrome ipscs in vivo when formed teratoma in nod-scid mice, and in vitro when differentiated into neuroprogenitors and neurons. <s4> these defects were associated with changes in the architecture and density of neurons, astroglial and oligodendroglial cells together with misexpression of genes involved in neurogenesis, lineage specification and differentiation. <s5> furthermore, we provide novel evidence that dual-specificity tyrosine-(y)-phosphorylation regulated kinase 1a (dyrk1a) on chromosome 21 likely contributes to these defects. <s6> importantly, we found that targeting dyrk1a pharmacologically or by shrna results in a considerable correction of these defects. 
lp+ss: HIV trans-activator protein (TAT) effectively transports large and small molecules across cellular membranes into larger populations of neurons. <s0> the use of n-type voltage-gated calcium channel (cav2.2) blockers to treat pain is limited by many physiological side effects. <s1> here we report that inflammatory and neuropathic hypersensitivity can be suppressed by inhibiting the binding of collapsin response mediator protein 2 (crmp-2) to cav2.2 and thereby reducing channel function. <s2> a peptide of crmp-2 fused to the hiv transactivator of transcription (tat) protein (tat-cbd3) decreased neuropeptide release from sensory neurons and excitatory synaptic transmission in dorsal horn neurons, reduced meningeal blood flow, reduced nocifensive behavior induced by formalin injection or corneal capsaicin application and reversed neuropathic hypersensitivity produced by an antiretroviral drug. <s3> tat-cbd3 was mildly anxiolytic without affecting memory retrieval, sensorimotor function or depression. <s4> at doses tenfold higher than that required to reduce hypersensitivity in vivo, tat-cbd3 caused a transient episode of tail kinking and body contortion. <s5> by preventing crmp-2–mediated enhancement of cav2.2 function, tat-cbd3 alleviated inflammatory and neuropathic hypersensitivity, an approach that may prove useful in managing chronic pain. 
lp+ss: HNF4A mutations are associated with macrosomia in infancy. <s0> type 1 cell-mediated immunity might play an important role in protection from typhoid fever. <s1> we evaluated whether immunization with salmonella enterica serovar typhi (s. typhi) strain cvd 908-htra (a delta aroc delta arod delta htra mutant), a leading live oral typhoid vaccine candidate, elicits specific cd4(+) and cd8(+) s. typhi immune responses. <s2> potent ctl responses and ifn-gamma secretion by cd8(+) t cells were detected following immunization with cvd 908-htra in high (4.5 x 10(8) cfu) and low (5 x 10(7) cfu) dosages. <s3> s. typhi-specific ctl were observed in six of eight vaccinees (four high and two low dose) after immunization. <s4> mean increases in the frequency of ifn-gamma spot-forming cells (sfc) in the presence of s. typhi-infected targets were 221 +/- <s5> 41 sfc/10(6) pbmc and 233 +/- <s6> 87 sfc/10(6) pbmc, in the high and low dose groups, respectively. <s7> strong cd4(+) t cell responses were also observed. <s8> increases in the ifn-gamma production to soluble s. typhi flagella (stf) occurred in 82 and 38% of the volunteers who received the high and low doses, respectively. <s9> robust correlations were observed between volunteers that responded with ifn-gamma sfc to stimulation with s. typhi-infected cells and ifn-gamma released in response to stimulation with stf ags (r = 0.822, p < 0.001) and between ctl and ifn-gamma production to stf (r = 0.818, p = 0.013). <s10> these data demonstrating the concomitant induction of both cd4- and cd8-mediated cmi are consistent with a significant role for type 1 immunity in controlling typhoid infection and support the continuing evaluation of cvd 908-htra as a typhoid vaccine candidate. 
lp+ss: HSCT-T dosage may not be diagnostic if the onset of symptoms occurs less than 3 hours before AMI. <s0> tetraploidy can arise from various mitotic or cleavage defects in mammalian cells, and inheritance of multiple centrosomes induces aneuploidy when tetraploid cells continue to cycle. <s1> arrest of the tetraploid cell cycle is therefore potentially a critical cellular control. <s2> we report here that primary rat embryo fibroblasts (ref52) and human foreskin fibroblasts become senescent in tetraploid g1 after drug- or small interfering rna (sirna)-induced failure of cell cleavage. <s3> in contrast, t-antigen-transformed ref52 and p53+/+ hct116 tumor cells rapidly become aneuploid by continuing to cycle after cleavage failure. <s4> tetraploid primary cells quickly become quiescent, as determined by loss of the ki-67 proliferation marker and of the fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator/late cell cycle marker geminin. <s5> arrest is not due to dna damage, as the γ-h2ax dna damage marker remains at control levels after tetraploidy induction. <s6> arrested tetraploid cells finally become senescent, as determined by sa-β-galactosidase activity. <s7> tetraploid arrest is dependent on p16ink4a expression, as sirna suppression of p16ink4a bypasses tetraploid arrest, permitting primary cells to become aneuploid. <s8> we conclude that tetraploid primary cells can become senescent without dna damage and that induction of senescence is critical to tetraploidy arrest.

lp+ss: HbA1c consistently overestimates glycemic control in black individuals with Sickle cell trait (SCT). <s0> partitioning tissues into compartments that do not intermix is essential for the correct morphogenesis of animal embryos and organs. <s1> several hypotheses have been proposed to explain compartmental cell sorting, mainly differential adhesion, but also regulation of the cytoskeleton or of cell proliferation. <s2> nevertheless, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that keep cells apart at boundaries remain unclear. <s3> here we demonstrate, in early drosophila melanogaster embryos, that actomyosin-based barriers stop cells from invading neighbouring compartments. <s4> our analysis shows that cells can transiently invade neighbouring compartments, especially when they divide, but are then pushed back into their compartment of origin. <s5> actomyosin cytoskeletal components are enriched at compartmental boundaries, forming cable-like structures when the epidermis is mitotically active. <s6> when myoii (non-muscle myosin ii) function is inhibited, including locally at the cable by chromophore-assisted laser inactivation (cali), in live embryos, dividing cells are no longer pushed back, leading to compartmental cell mixing. <s7> we propose that local regulation of actomyosin contractibility, rather than differential adhesion, is the primary mechanism sorting cells at compartmental boundaries. 
lp+ss: HbA1c consistently overestimates glycemic control in black individuals with Sickle cell trait (SCT). <s0> posttranslational modifications mediate important regulatory functions in biology. <s1> the acetylation of the p53 transcription factor, for example, promotes transcriptional activation of target genes including p21. <s2> here we show that the acetylation of two lysine residues in p53 promotes recruitment of the tfiid subunit taf1 to the p21 promoter through its bromodomains. <s3> uv irradiation of cells diacetylates p53 at lysines 373 and 382, which in turn recruits taf1 to a distal p53-binding site on the p21 promoter prior to looping to the core promoter. <s4> disruption of acetyl-p53/bromodomain interaction inhibits taf1 recruitment to both the distal p53-binding site and the core promoter. <s5> further, the tfiid subunits taf4, taf5, and tbp are detected on the core promoter prior to taf1, suggesting that, upon dna damage, distinct subunits of tfiid may be recruited separately to the p21 promoter and that the transcriptional activation depends on posttranslational modification of the p53 transcription factor.

lp+ss: Healthy volunteers exhibit rapid and transient increase of cellular ATP after being bolus-injected with fructose. <s0> introduction angiopoietin-2 (ang-2), an angiogenic peptide released by endothelial cell weibel-palade bodies (wpbs), increases endothelial activation and vascular permeability. <s1> ang-2 is raised in severe sepsis but the mechanisms underlying this are not known. <s2> nitric oxide (no) inhibits wpb exocytosis, and bioavailability of endothelial no is decreased in sepsis. <s3> we hypothesized that endothelial no bioavailability would be inversely correlated with ang-2 concentrations in sepsis.  <s4> methods plasma ang-2, vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) and endothelial-active cytokines were assessed in 83 patients with early sepsis and 41 hospital controls, and related to reactive hyperaemia-peripheral arterial tonometry, rh-pat, a measure of endothelial no bioavailability.  <s5> results plasma ang-2 was elevated in sepsis (median [interquartile range (iqr)], ng/ml: severe sepsis 12.4 [8.5-33.4], sepsis without organ failure 6.1 [5.0-10.4], controls 2.7 [2.2-3.6], p < 0.0001). <s6> it correlated inversely with rh-pat (r = -0.38, p < 0.0001) and positively with il-6 (r = 0.57, p < 0.0001) and degree of organ failure (sequential organ function assessment score) (r = 0.58, p < 0.0001). <s7> the correlation of ang-2 with rh-pat persisted after controlling for sepsis severity. <s8> in a longitudinal mixed-effects model, recovery of rh-pat over time was associated with decline in ang-2.  <s9> conclusions ang-2 is elevated in proportion to sepsis severity, and inversely correlated with no-dependent microvascular reactivity. <s10> impaired endothelial no bioavailability may contribute to increased endothelial cell release of ang-2, endothelial activation and capillary leak. <s11> agents that increase endothelial no bioavailability or inhibit wpb exocytosis and/or ang-2 activity may have therapeutic potential in sepsis.

lp+ss: Hematopoietic Stem Cell purification reaches purity rates above 90%. <s0> heterogeneity within the self-renewal durability of adult hematopoietic stem cells (hscs) challenges our understanding of the molecular framework underlying hsc function. <s1> gene expression studies have been hampered by the presence of multiple hsc subtypes and contaminating non-hscs in bulk hsc populations. <s2> to gain deeper insight into the gene expression program of murine hscs, we combined single-cell functional assays with flow cytometric index sorting and single-cell gene expression assays. <s3> through bioinformatic integration of these datasets, we designed an unbiased sorting strategy that separates non-hscs away from hscs, and single-cell transplantation experiments using the enriched population were combined with rna-seq data to identify key molecules that associate with long-term durable self-renewal, producing a single-cell molecular dataset that is linked to functional stem cell activity. <s4> finally, we demonstrated the broader applicability of this approach for linking key molecules with defined cellular functions in another stem cell system.

lp+ss: Homozygous deletion of murine Sbds gene from osterix-expressing mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells (MPCs) induces oxidative stress. <s0> neuronal growth cones move forward by dynamically connecting actin-based motility to substrate adhesion, but the mechanisms at the individual molecular level remain unclear. <s1> we cultured primary neurons on n-cadherin-coated micropatterned substrates, and imaged adhesion and cytoskeletal proteins at the ventral surface of growth cones using single particle tracking combined to photoactivated localization microscopy (sptpalm). <s2> we demonstrate transient interactions in the second time scale between flowing actin filaments and immobilized n-cadherin/catenin complexes, translating into a local reduction of the actin retrograde flow. <s3> normal actin flow on micropatterns was rescued by expression of a dominant negative n-cadherin construct competing for the coupling between actin and endogenous n-cadherin. <s4> fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (frap) experiments confirmed the differential kinetics of actin and n-cadherin, and further revealed a 20% actin population confined at n-cadherin micropatterns, contributing to local actin accumulation. <s5> computer simulations with relevant kinetic parameters modeled n-cadherin and actin turnover well, validating this mechanism. <s6> such a combination of short- and long-lived interactions between the motile actin network and spatially restricted adhesive complexes represents a two-tiered clutch mechanism likely to sustain dynamic environment sensing and provide the force necessary for growth cone migration.

lp+ss: Hypothalamic glutamate neurotransmission is unrelated to energy balance. <s0> background upregulated by atheroprotective flow, the transcription factor krüppel-like factor 2 (klf2) is crucial for maintaining endothelial function. <s1> micrornas (mirnas) are noncoding small rnas that regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. <s2> we examined the role of mirnas, particularly mir-92a, in the atheroprotective flow-regulated klf2.  <s3> methods and results dicer knockdown increased the level of klf2 mrna in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, suggesting that klf2 is regulated by mirna. <s4> in silico analysis predicted that mir-92a could bind to the 3' untranslated region of klf2 mrna. <s5> overexpression of mir-92a decreased the expression of klf2 and the klf2-regulated endothelial nitric oxide synthase and thrombomodulin at mrna and protein levels. <s6> a complementary finding is that mir-92a inhibitor increased the mrna and protein expression of klf2, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and thrombomodulin. <s7> subsequent studies revealed that atheroprotective laminar flow downregulated the level of mir-92a precursor to induce klf2, and the level of this flow-induced klf2 was reduced by mir-92a precursor. <s8> furthermore, mir-92a level was lower in human umbilical vein endothelial cells exposed to the atheroprotective pulsatile shear flow than under atheroprone oscillatory shear flow. <s9> anti-ago1/2 immunoprecipitation coupled with real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed that pulsatile shear flow decreased the functional targeting of mir-92a precursor/klf2 mrna in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. <s10> consistent with these findings, mouse carotid arteries receiving mir-92a precursor exhibited impaired vasodilatory response to flow.  <s11> conclusions atheroprotective flow patterns decrease the level of mir-92a, which in turn increases klf2 expression to maintain endothelial homeostasis. 
lp+ss: Hypothalamic glutamate neurotransmission is unrelated to energy balance. <s0> the environment in which the fetus develops is critical for its survival and long-term health. <s1> the regulation of normal human fetal growth involves many multidirectional interactions between the mother, placenta, and fetus. <s2> the mother supplies nutrients and oxygen to the fetus via the placenta. <s3> the fetus influences the provision of maternal nutrients via the placental production of hormones that regulate maternal metabolism. <s4> the placenta is the site of exchange between mother and fetus and regulates fetal growth via the production and metabolism of growth-regulating hormones such as igfs and glucocorticoids. <s5> adequate trophoblast invasion in early pregnancy and increased uteroplacental blood flow ensure sufficient growth of the uterus, placenta, and fetus. <s6> the placenta may respond to fetal endocrine signals to increase transport of maternal nutrients by growth of the placenta, by activation of transport systems, and by production of placental hormones to influence maternal physiology and even behavior. <s7> there are consequences of poor fetal growth both in the short term and long term, in the form of increased mortality and morbidity. <s8> endocrine regulation of fetal growth involves interactions between the mother, placenta, and fetus, and these effects may program long-term physiology. 
lp+ss: Hypothalamic glutamate neurotransmission is unrelated to energy balance. <s0> in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (arc), pro-opiomelanocortin (pomc) neurons inhibit feeding and neuropeptide-y (npy) neurons stimulate feeding. <s1> we tested whether neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (vmh), a known satiety center, activate anorexigenic neuronal pathways in the arc by projecting either excitatory synaptic inputs to pomc neurons and/or inhibitory inputs to npy neurons. <s2> using laser scanning photostimulation in brain slices from transgenic mice, we found that pomc and npy neurons, which are interspersed in the arc, are nevertheless regulated by anatomically distinct synaptic inputs. <s3> pomc neurons received strong excitatory input from the medial vmh (mvmh), whereas npy neurons did not and, instead, received weak inhibitory input only from within the arc. <s4> the strength of the excitatory input from the mvmh to pomc neurons was diminished by fasting. <s5> these data identify a new molecularly defined circuit that is dynamically regulated by nutritional state in a manner consistent with the known role of the vmh as a satiety center.

lp+ss: IFIT1 speeds viral replication by allowing for the proliferation of mis-capped viral RNAs. <s0> the cytosolic helicase retinoic acid-inducible gene-i (rig-i) initiates immune responses to most rna viruses by detecting viral 5'-triphosphorylated rna (ppprna). <s1> although endogenous mrna is also 5'-triphosphorylated, backbone modifications and the 5'-ppp-linked methylguanosine ((m7)g) cap prevent immunorecognition. <s2> here we show that the methylation status of endogenous capped mrna at the 5'-terminal nucleotide (n1) was crucial to prevent rig-i activation. <s3> moreover, we identified a single conserved amino acid (h830) in the rig-i rna binding pocket as the mediator of steric exclusion of n1-2'o-methylated rna. <s4> h830a alteration (rig-i(h830a)) restored binding of n1-2'o-methylated ppprna. <s5> consequently, endogenous mrna activated the rig-i(h830a) mutant but not wild-type rig-i. similarly, knockdown of the endogenous n1-2'o-methyltransferase led to considerable rig-i stimulation in the absence of exogenous stimuli. <s6> studies involving yellow-fever-virus-encoded 2'o-methyltransferase and rig-i(h830a) revealed that viruses exploit this mechanism to escape rig-i. our data reveal a new role for cap n1-2'o-methylation in rig-i tolerance of self-rna.

lp+ss: Immune complex triggered cell death leads to extracellular release of nuclear DNA. <s0> neutrophil extracellular traps (nets) are implicated in autoimmunity, but how they are generated and their roles in sterile inflammation remain unclear. <s1> ribonucleoprotein immune complexes (rnp ics), inducers of netosis, require mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ros) for maximal net stimulation. <s2> after rnp ic stimulation of neutrophils, mitochondria become hypopolarized and translocate to the cell surface. <s3> extracellular release of oxidized mitochondrial dna is proinflammatory in vitro, and when this dna is injected into mice, it stimulates type i interferon (ifn) signaling through a pathway dependent on the dna sensor sting. <s4> mitochondrial ros are also necessary for spontaneous netosis of low-density granulocytes from individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus. <s5> this was also observed in individuals with chronic granulomatous disease, who lack nadph oxidase activity but still develop autoimmunity and type i ifn signatures. <s6> mitochondrial ros inhibition in vivo reduces disease severity and type i ifn responses in a mouse model of lupus. <s7> together, these findings highlight a role for mitochondria in the generation not only of nets but also of pro-inflammatory oxidized mitochondrial dna in autoimmune diseases. 
lp+ss: Immune responses in immune cells are geographically segregated. <s0> granulomas are the pathological hallmark of tuberculosis (tb). <s1> however, their function and mechanisms of formation remain poorly understood. <s2> to understand the role of granulomas in tb, we analyzed the proteomes of granulomas from subjects with tuberculosis in an unbiased manner. <s3> using laser-capture microdissection, mass spectrometry and confocal microscopy, we generated detailed molecular maps of human granulomas. <s4> we found that the centers of granulomas have a pro-inflammatory environment that is characterized by the presence of antimicrobial peptides, reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. <s5> conversely, the tissue surrounding the caseum has a comparatively anti-inflammatory signature. <s6> these findings are consistent across a set of six human subjects and in rabbits. <s7> although the balance between systemic pro- and anti-inflammatory signals is crucial to tb disease outcome, here we find that these signals are physically segregated within each granuloma. <s8> from the protein and lipid snapshots of human and rabbit lesions analyzed here, we hypothesize that the pathologic response to tb is shaped by the precise anatomical localization of these inflammatory pathways during the development of the granuloma.

lp+ss: Improvements in OER catalysts show stable activity over several hundred hours. <s0> earth-abundant first-row (3d) transition metal–based catalysts have been developed for the oxygen-evolution reaction (oer); however, they operate at overpotentials substantially above thermodynamic requirements. <s1> density functional theory suggested that non-3d high-valency metals such as tungsten can modulate 3d metal oxides, providing near-optimal adsorption energies for oer intermediates. <s2> we developed a room-temperature synthesis to produce gelled oxyhydroxides materials with an atomically homogeneous metal distribution. <s3> these gelled fecow oxyhydroxides exhibit the lowest overpotential (191 millivolts) reported at 10 milliamperes per square centimeter in alkaline electrolyte. <s4> the catalyst shows no evidence of degradation after more than 500 hours of operation. <s5> x-ray absorption and computational studies reveal a synergistic interplay between tungsten, iron, and cobalt in producing a favorable local coordination environment and electronic structure that enhance the energetics for oer.

lp+ss: Improvements in OER catalysts show stable activity over several hundred hours. <s0> trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of african sleeping sickness, is transmitted to its mammalian host by the tsetse. <s1> in the fly, the parasite's surface is covered with invariant procyclin, while in the mammal it resides extracellularly in its bloodstream form (bf) and is densely covered with highly immunogenic variant surface glycoprotein (vsg). <s2> in the bf, the parasite varies this highly immunogenic surface vsg using a repertoire of ~2500 distinct vsg genes. <s3> recent reports in mammalian systems point to a role for histone acetyl-lysine recognizing bromodomain proteins in the maintenance of stem cell fate, leading us to hypothesize that bromodomain proteins may maintain the bf cell fate in trypanosomes. <s4> using small-molecule inhibitors and genetic mutants for individual bromodomain proteins, we performed rna-seq experiments that revealed changes in the transcriptome similar to those seen in cells differentiating from the bf to the insect stage. <s5> this was recapitulated at the protein level by the appearance of insect-stage proteins on the cell surface. <s6> furthermore, bromodomain inhibition disrupts two major bf-specific immune evasion mechanisms that trypanosomes harness to evade mammalian host antibody responses. <s7> first, monoallelic expression of the antigenically varied vsg is disrupted. <s8> second, rapid internalization of antibodies bound to vsg on the surface of the trypanosome is blocked. <s9> thus, our studies reveal a role for trypanosome bromodomain proteins in maintaining bloodstream stage identity and immune evasion. <s10> importantly, bromodomain inhibition leads to a decrease in virulence in a mouse model of infection, establishing these proteins as potential therapeutic drug targets for trypanosomiasis. <s11> our 1.25å resolution crystal structure of a trypanosome bromodomain in complex with i-bet151 reveals a novel binding mode of the inhibitor, which serves as a promising starting point for rational drug design.

lp+ss: In S. cerevisiae, the absence of RNA surveillance pathways causes sensitivity to high iron conditions. <s0> recent studies indicate both clinical and mechanistic links between atherosclerotic heart disease and intestinal microbial metabolism of certain dietary nutrients producing trimethylamine n-oxide (tmao). <s1> here we test the hypothesis that gut microbial transplantation can transmit choline diet-induced tmao production and atherosclerosis susceptibility. <s2> first, a strong association was noted between atherosclerotic plaque and plasma tmao levels in a mouse diversity panel (n = 22 strains, r = 0.38; p = 0.0001). <s3> an atherosclerosis-prone and high tmao-producing strain, c57bl/6j, and an atherosclerosis-resistant and low tmao-producing strain, nzw/lacj, were selected as donors for cecal microbial transplantation into apolipoprotein e null mice in which resident intestinal microbes were first suppressed with antibiotics. <s4> trimethylamine (tma) and tmao levels were initially higher in recipients on choline diet that received cecal microbes from c57bl/6j inbred mice; however, durability of choline diet-dependent differences in tma/tmao levels was not maintained to the end of the study. <s5> mice receiving c57bl/6j cecal microbes demonstrated choline diet-dependent enhancement in atherosclerotic plaque burden as compared with recipients of nzw/lacj microbes. <s6> microbial dna analyses in feces and cecum revealed transplantation of donor microbial community features into recipients with differences in taxa proportions between donor strains that were transmissible to recipients and that tended to show coincident proportions with tmao levels. <s7> proportions of specific taxa were also identified that correlated with plasma tmao levels in donors and recipients and with atherosclerotic lesion area in recipients. <s8> atherosclerosis susceptibility may be transmitted via transplantation of gut microbiota. <s9> gut microbes may thus represent a novel therapeutic target for modulating atherosclerosis susceptibility.

lp+ss: In S. cerevisiae, the absence of RNA surveillance pathways reduces sensitivity to high iron conditions. <s0> after cell-to-cell transmission, htlv-i increases its viral genome by de novo infection and proliferation of infected cells. <s1> proliferation of infected cells is clonal and persistent in vivo. <s2> during the carrier state, infected cells are selected in vivo by the host's immune system, the genetic and epigenetic environment of proviral integration sites, and other factors. <s3> in leukemic cells, tax gene expression is frequently impaired by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. <s4> such loss of tax expression enables atl cells to escape the host immune system. <s5> on the other hand, atl cells acquire the ability to proliferate without tax by intracellular genetic and epigenetic changes. <s6> despite advances in support and the development of novel treatment agents, the prognosis for atll remains poor. <s7> a number of therapies, however, do appear to improve prognosis compared to chop (vepa). <s8> these include interferon-α plus zidovudine (probably after 1–2 cycles of chop), intensive chemotherapy as in lsg-15 with g-csf support and allo-sct (which includes the potential for cure). <s9> emerging novel approaches include hdac inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and proteasome inhibitors. <s10> comparison between different therapeutic approaches is complicated by the range of natural history of atll, different recruitments of naïve-to-therapy, refractory or relapsed patients, and variations in the reporting of outcome that frequently excludes difficult-to-evaluate patients. <s11> moreover, results from relatively small proof-of-principle studies have not been extended with randomized, controlled trials. <s12> as a result, currently, there is no clear evidence to support the value of any particular treatment approach over others. <s13> to avoid further unnecessary patient suffering and to identify optimal therapy as rapidly as possible, large randomized, controlled trials encompassing multicenter, international collaborations will be necessary. 
lp+ss: In a naive state, blocking Wingless-Int-1 secretion from mouse embryonic stem cells inhibits self-renewal of the mouse embryonic stem cells. <s0> pluripotent stem cells exist in naive and primed states, epitomized by mouse embryonic stem cells (escs) and the developmentally more advanced epiblast stem cells (episcs; ref. ). <s1> in the naive state of escs, the genome has an unusual open conformation and possesses a minimum of repressive epigenetic marks. <s2> in contrast, episcs have activated the epigenetic machinery that supports differentiation towards the embryonic cell types. <s3> the transition from naive to primed pluripotency therefore represents a pivotal event in cellular differentiation. <s4> but the signals that control this fundamental differentiation step remain unclear. <s5> we show here that paracrine and autocrine wnt signals are essential self-renewal factors for escs, and are required to inhibit their differentiation into episcs. <s6> moreover, we find that wnt proteins in combination with the cytokine lif are sufficient to support esc self-renewal in the absence of any undefined factors, and support the derivation of new esc lines, including ones from non-permissive mouse strains. <s7> our results not only demonstrate that wnt signals regulate the naive-to-primed pluripotency transition, but also identify wnt as an essential and limiting esc self-renewal factor.

lp+ss: In breast cancer, the loss of myoepithelial cells slows the transition of ductal carcinoma in situ to invasive carcinoma. <s0> cytochrome p450 (p450)-dependent metabolites of arachidonic acid, the epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (eets), are proposed to be endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors (edhf) that affect vascular tone; however, the effects of edhf on endothelial-derived nitric oxide biosynthesis remain unknown. <s1> we examined the regulation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (enos) by edhf and investigated the relevant signaling pathways involved. <s2> the p450 epoxygenases cyp102 f87v mutant, cyp2c11-cypor, and cyp2j2 were transfected into cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells, and the effects of endogenously formed or exogenously applied eets on enos expression and activity were assessed. <s3> transfection with the p450 epoxygenases led to increased enos protein expression, an effect that was attenuated by cotreatment with the p450 inhibitor 17-odya. <s4> northern analysis demonstrated that p450 transfection led to increased enos mrna levels consistent with an effect at the pretranslational level. <s5> p450 epoxygenase transfection resulted in increased enos activity as measured by the conversion of l-arginine to l-citrulline. <s6> addition of synthetic eets (50-200 nm) to the culture media also increased enos expression and activity. <s7> treatment with mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk), mapk kinase, and protein kinase c inhibitors apigenin, 2'-amino-3'-methoxyflavone (pd98059), and 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (h-7), respectively, significantly inhibited the effects of p450 transfection on enos expression. <s8> overexpression of p450 epoxygenases or addition of synthetic eets increased thr495 phosphorylation of enos, an effect that was inhibited by both apigenin and pd98059. <s9> overexpression of p450 epoxygenases in rats resulted in increased aortic enos expression, providing direct evidence that edhf can influence vascular enos levels in vivo. <s10> based on this data, we conclude that edhf up-regulates enos via activation of mapk and protein kinase c signaling pathways. 
lp+ss: In breast cancer, the loss of myoepithelial cells slows the transition of ductal carcinoma in situ to invasive carcinoma. <s0> leukemias and other cancers possess self-renewing stem cells that help to maintain the cancer. <s1> cancer stem cell eradication is thought to be crucial for successful anticancer therapy. <s2> using an acute myeloid leukemia (aml) model induced by the leukemia-associated monocytic leukemia zinc finger (moz)-tif2 fusion protein, we show here that aml can be cured by the ablation of leukemia stem cells. <s3> the moz fusion proteins moz-tif2 and moz-cbp interacted with the transcription factor pu.1 to stimulate the expression of macrophage colony–stimulating factor receptor (csf1r, also known as m-csfr, c-fms or cd115). <s4> studies using pu.1-deficient mice showed that pu.1 is essential for the ability of moz-tif2 to establish and maintain aml stem cells. <s5> cells expressing high amounts of csf1r (csf1rhigh cells), but not those expressing low amounts of csf1r (csf1rlow cells), showed potent leukemia-initiating activity. <s6> using transgenic mice expressing a drug-inducible suicide gene controlled by the csf1r promoter, we cured aml by ablation of csf1rhigh cells. <s7> moreover, induction of aml was suppressed in csf1r-deficient mice and csf1r inhibitors slowed the progression of moz-tif2–induced leukemia. <s8> thus, in this subtype of aml, leukemia stem cells are contained within the csf1rhigh cell population, and we suggest that targeting of pu.1-mediated upregulation of csf1r expression might be a useful therapeutic approach.

lp+ss: In rhesus macaques, daily subcutaneous injections of emtricitabine are ineffective at protecting against rectally transmitted simian-human immunodeficiency virus. <s0> vap (vapa and vapb) is an evolutionarily conserved endoplasmic reticulum (er)-anchored protein that helps generate tethers between the er and other membranes through which lipids are exchanged across adjacent bilayers. <s1> here, we report that by regulating pi4p levels on endosomes, vap affects wash-dependent actin nucleation on these organelles and the function of the retromer, a protein coat responsible for endosome-to-golgi traffic. <s2> vap is recruited to retromer budding sites on endosomes via an interaction with the retromer snx2 subunit. <s3> cells lacking vap accumulate high levels of pi4p, actin comets, and trans-golgi proteins on endosomes. <s4> such defects are mimicked by downregulation of osbp, a vap interactor and pi4p transporter that participates in vap-dependent er-endosomes tethers. <s5> these results reveal a role of pi4p in retromer-/wash-dependent budding from endosomes. <s6> collectively, our data show how the er can control budding dynamics and association with the cytoskeleton of another membrane by direct contacts leading to bilayer lipid modifications. 
lp+ss: In rhesus macaques, daily subcutaneous injections of tenofovir protects against rectally transmitted simian-human immunodeficiency virus. <s0> background in the absence of an effective vaccine, hiv continues to spread globally, emphasizing the need for novel strategies to limit its transmission. <s1> pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep) with antiretroviral drugs could prove to be an effective intervention strategy if highly efficacious and cost-effective prep modalities are identified. <s2> we evaluated daily and intermittent prep regimens of increasing antiviral activity in a macaque model that closely resembles human transmission.  <s3> methods and findings we used a repeat-exposure macaque model with 14 weekly rectal virus challenges. <s4> three drug treatments were given once daily, each to a different group of six rhesus macaques. <s5> group 1 was treated subcutaneously with a human-equivalent dose of emtricitabine (ftc), group 2 received orally the human-equivalent dosing of both ftc and tenofovir-disoproxil fumarate (tdf), and group 3 received subcutaneously a similar dosing of ftc and a higher dose of tenofovir. <s6> a fourth group of six rhesus macaques (group 4) received intermittently a prep regimen similar to group 3 only 2 h before and 24 h after each weekly virus challenge. <s7> results were compared to 18 control macaques that did not receive any drug treatment. <s8> the risk of infection in macaques treated in groups 1 and 2 was 3.8- and 7.8-fold lower than in untreated macaques (p = 0.02 and p = 0.008, respectively). <s9> all six macaques in group 3 were protected. <s10> breakthrough infections had blunted acute viremias; drug resistance was seen in two of six animals. <s11> all six animals in group 4 that received intermittent prep were protected.  <s12> conclusions this model suggests that single drugs for daily prep can be protective but a combination of antiretroviral drugs may be required to increase the level of protection. <s13> short but potent intermittent prep can provide protection comparable to that of daily prep in this shiv/macaque model. <s14> these findings support prep trials for hiv prevention in humans and identify promising prep modalities.

lp+ss: Incidence of heart failure increased by 10% in women since 1979. <s0> cytokinesis entails cell invagination by a contractile actomyosin ring. <s1> in epithelia, e-cadherin-mediated adhesion connects the cortices of contacting cells; thus, it is unclear how invagination occurs, how the new junction forms, and how tissue integrity is preserved. <s2> investigations in drosophila embryos first show that apicobasal cleavage is polarized: invagination is faster from the basal than from the apical side. <s3> ring contraction but not its polarized constriction is controlled by septin filaments and anillin. <s4> polarized cleavage is due instead to mechanical anchorage of the ring to e-cadherin complexes. <s5> formation of the new junction requires local adhesion disengagement in the cleavage furrow, followed by new e-cadherin complex formation at the new interface. <s6> e-cadherin disengagement depends on the tension exerted by the cytokinetic ring and by neighboring cells. <s7> we uncover intrinsic and extrinsic forces necessary for cytokinesis and present a framework for understanding how tissue cohesion is preserved during epithelial division.

lp+ss: Incidence of sepsis has fallen substantially from 2009 to 2014. <s0> studying the metabolism of immune cells in recent years has emphasized the tight link existing between the metabolic state and the phenotype of these cells. <s1> macrophages in particular are a good example of this phenomenon. <s2> whether the macrophage obtains its energy through glycolysis or through oxidative metabolism can give rise to different phenotypes. <s3> classically activated or m1 macrophages are key players of the first line of defense against bacterial infections and are known to obtain energy through glycolysis. <s4> alternatively activated or m2 macrophages on the other hand are involved in tissue repair and wound healing and use oxidative metabolism to fuel their longer-term functions. <s5> metabolic intermediates, however, are not just a source of energy but can be directly implicated in a particular macrophage phenotype. <s6> in m1 macrophages, the krebs cycle intermediate succinate regulates hif1α, which is responsible for driving the sustained production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine il1β. <s7> in m2 macrophages, the sedoheptulose kinase carbohydrate kinase-like protein is critical for regulating the pentose phosphate pathway. <s8> the potential to target these events and impact on disease is an exciting prospect.

lp+ss: Including pharmacists in rounding teams reduces the incidence of adverse drug events (ADEs). <s0> the cell-cycle regulating gene, p16ink4a, encoding an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6, is considered to play an important role in cellular aging and in premature senescence. <s1> although there is an age-dependent increase of p16ink4a expression in human fibroblast senescence in vitro, no data are available regarding the age dependency of p16ink4a in vivo. <s2> to determine whether p16ink4a expression in human skin correlates with donor age, p16ink4a expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry as well as the expression of the p16ink4a repressor bmi1. <s3> samples from the age groups 0-20, 21-70, and 71-95 years were selected from a bank of healthy human skin. <s4> we show that the number of p16ink4a positive cells is significantly higher in elderly individuals compared to the younger age groups. <s5> the number of p16ink4a positive cells was found to be increased in both epidermis and dermis, compartments with strictly different proliferative activities. <s6> bmi1 gene expression was significantly down-regulated with increasing donor age, whereas no striking age differences were observed for ki67. <s7> in immunofluorescence co-expression studies, ki67-positive cells were negative for p16ink4a and bmi1-expressing cells also stained negatively for ki67. <s8> in conclusion, we provide for the first time evidence that p16ink4a expression directly correlates with chronological aging of human skin in vivo. <s9> p16ink4a therefore is a biomarker for human aging in vivo. <s10> the data reported here suggest a model for changes in regulatory gene expression that drive aging in human skin. 
lp+ss: Increased LDL receptors plays a role in the reduction of plasma Lp(a). <s0> background alirocumab, a monoclonal antibody to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (pcsk9), lowers plasma low-density lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol and apolipoprotein b100 (apob). <s1> although studies in mice and cells have identified increased hepatic ldl receptors as the basis for ldl lowering by pcsk9 inhibitors, there have been no human studies characterizing the effects of pcsk9 inhibitors on lipoprotein metabolism. <s2> in particular, it is not known whether inhibition of pcsk9 has any effects on very low-density lipoprotein or intermediate-density lipoprotein (idl) metabolism. <s3> inhibition of pcsk9 also results in reductions of plasma lipoprotein (a) levels. <s4> the regulation of plasma lp(a) levels, including the role of ldl receptors in the clearance of lp(a), is poorly defined, and no mechanistic studies of the lp(a) lowering by alirocumab in humans have been published to date.  <s5> methods eighteen (10 f, 8 mol/l) participants completed a placebo-controlled, 2-period study. <s6> they received 2 doses of placebo, 2 weeks apart, followed by 5 doses of 150 mg of alirocumab, 2 weeks apart. <s7> at the end of each period, fractional clearance rates (fcrs) and production rates (prs) of apob and apo(a) were determined. <s8> in 10 participants, postprandial triglycerides and apob48 levels were measured.  <s9> results alirocumab reduced ultracentrifugally isolated ldl-c by 55.1%, ldl-apob by 56.3%, and plasma lp(a) by 18.7%. <s10> the fall in ldl-apob was caused by an 80.4% increase in ldl-apob fcr and a 23.9% reduction in ldl-apob pr. <s11> the latter was due to a 46.1% increase in idl-apob fcr coupled with a 27.2% decrease in conversion of idl to ldl. <s12> the fcr of apo(a) tended to increase (24.6%) without any change in apo(a) pr. <s13> alirocumab had no effects on fcrs or prs of very low-density lipoproteins-apob and very low-density lipoproteins triglycerides or on postprandial plasma triglycerides or apob48 concentrations.  <s14> conclusions alirocumab decreased ldl-c and ldl-apob by increasing idl- and ldl-apob fcrs and decreasing ldl-apob pr. <s15> these results are consistent with increases in ldl receptors available to clear idl and ldl from blood during pcsk9 inhibition. <s16> the increase in apo(a) fcr during alirocumab treatment suggests that increased ldl receptors may also play a role in the reduction of plasma lp(a).    <s17> clinical trial registration url: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. <s18> unique identifier: nct01959971.

lp+ss: Increased diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm. <s0> direct induction of induced hepatocytes (iheps) from fibroblasts holds potential as a strategy for regenerative medicine but until now has only been shown in culture settings. <s1> here, we describe in vivo ihep formation using transcription factor induction and genetic fate tracing in mouse models of chronic liver disease. <s2> we show that ectopic expression of the transcription factors foxa3, gata4, hnf1a, and hnf4a from a polycistronic lentiviral vector converts mouse myofibroblasts into cells with a hepatocyte phenotype. <s3> in vivo expression of the same set of transcription factors from a p75 neurotrophin receptor peptide (p75ntrp)-tagged adenovirus enabled the generation of hepatocyte-like cells from myofibroblasts in fibrotic mouse livers and reduced liver fibrosis. <s4> we have therefore been able to convert pro-fibrogenic myofibroblasts in the liver into hepatocyte-like cells with positive functional benefits. <s5> this direct in vivo reprogramming approach may open new avenues for the treatment of chronic liver disease. 
lp+ss: Increased flux of microbial products provokes immune responses. <s0> there is a growing interest in the cell-cell communication roles in cancer mediated by secreted vesicles termed exosomes. <s1> in this study, we examined whether exosomes produced by cancer cells could transmit information to normal stromal fibroblasts and trigger a cellular response. <s2> we found that some cancer-derived exosomes could trigger elevated α-smooth muscle actin expression and other changes consistent with the process of fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts. <s3> we show that tgf-β is expressed at the exosome surface in association with the transmembrane proteoglycan betaglycan. <s4> although existing in a latent state, this complex was fully functional in eliciting smad-dependent signaling. <s5> inhibiting either signaling or betaglycan expression attenuated differentiation. <s6> while the kinetics and overall magnitude of the response were similar to that achieved with soluble tgf-β, we identified important qualitative differences unique to the exosomal route of tgf-β delivery, as exemplified by a significant elevation in fibroblast fgf2 production. <s7> this hitherto unknown trigger for instigating cellular differentiation in a distinctive manner has major implications for mechanisms underlying cancer-recruited stroma, fibrotic diseases, and wound-healing responses. 
lp+ss: Increased flux of microbial products suppresses immune responses. <s0> cells develop by reading mixed signals. <s1> nowhere is this clearer than in the highly dynamic processes that propel embryogenesis, when critical cell-fate decisions are made swiftly in response to well-orchestrated growthfactor combinations. <s2> learning how diverse signaling pathways are integrated is therefore essential for understanding physiology. <s3> this requires the identification, in tangible molecular terms, of key nodes for pathway integration that operate in vivo. <s4> a report in this issue, on the integration of smad and ras/mapk pathways during neural induction (pera et al. 2003), provides timely insights into the relevance of one such node. <s5> pera et al. (2003) report that fgf8 and igf2—two growth factors that activate the ras/mapk pathway— favor neural differentiation and mesoderm dorsalization in xenopus by inhibiting bmp (bone morphogenetic protein) signaling. <s6> mesoderm is formed from ectoderm in response to nodal-related signals from the endoderm at the blastula stage and beyond (fig. 1; for review, see de robertis et al. 2000). <s7> bmp induces differentiation of ectoderm into epidermal cell fates at the expense of neural fates, and it ventralizes the mesoderm at the expense of dorsal fates (for review, see weinstein and hemmatibrivanlou 1999; de robertis et al. 2000). <s8> accordingly, neural differentiation and dorsal mesoderm formation are favored when bmp signaling is attenuated. <s9> noggin, chordin, cerberus, and follistatin, secreted by the spemann organizer on the dorsal side at the gastrula stage, facilitate the formation of neural tissue by sequestering bmp (weinstein and hemmati-brivanlou 1999; de robertis et al. 2000). <s10> experimentally blocking bmp signaling with a dominant-negative bmp receptor has a similar effect of promoting ectoderm neuralization (weinstein and hemmati-brivanlou 1999). <s11> as it turns out, neural induction can also be achieved with fgf (fibroblast growth factor; kengaku and okamoto 1993; lamb and harland 1995; hongo et al. 1999; hardcastle et al. 2000; streit et al. 2000; wilson et al. 2000) and igf (insulin-like growth factor; pera et al. 2001; richard-parpaillon et al. 2002). <s12> injection of transcripts encoding fgf8 or ifg2 into one animal-pole blastomere of a fourto eight-cell embryo results in an expanded neural plate at the injected side (pera et al. 2003). <s13> surprisingly, expression of a dominant-negative fgf receptor prevents neuralization of ectoderm explants by the bmp blocker noggin (launay et al. 1996). <s14> likewise, the potent neuralizing effect of chordin can be blocked by a dominant-negative fgf receptor or a morpholino oligonucleotide targeting the igf receptor (pera et al. 2003). <s15> thus, the neuralizing effect of bmp inhibitors is somehow tied to fgf and ifg signaling. <s16> the question is, how? <s17> because fgf8 and ifg2 activate mapk, pera et al. (2003) took heed from previous work showing that mapk inhibits the bmp signal-transduction factor smad1 (kretzschmar et al. 1997a). <s18> smad1 is directly phosphorylated by the bmp receptor, resulting in smad1 activation (kretzschmar et al. 1997b), and by mapk in response to egf, resulting in smad1 inhibition (kretzschmar et al. 1997a; fig. 2). <s19> smad transcription factors mediate gene responses to the entire tgf (transforming growth factor) family, to which the bmps belong (for review, see massague 2000; derynck and zhang 2003). <s20> smads 1, 5, and 8 act primarily downstream of bmp receptors and smads 2 and 3 downstream of tgf , activin and nodal receptors. <s21> smad proteins have two conserved globular domains—the mh1 and mh2 domains (fig. 2). <s22> the mh1 domain is involved in dna binding and the mh2 domain in binding to cytoplasmic retention factors, activated receptors, nucleoporins in the nuclear pore, and dna-binding cofactors, coactivators, and corepressors in the nucleus (for review, see shi and massague 2003). <s23> receptor-mediated phosphorylation occurs at the carboxy-terminal sequence sxs. <s24> this enables the nuclear accumulation of smads and their association with the shared partner smad4 to form transcriptional complexes that are interpreted by the cell as a function of the context (massague 2000). <s25> between the mh1 and mh2 domains lies a linker region of variable sequence and length. <s26> attention was drawn to this region when it was found that egf (epidermal growth factor), a classical activator of the ras/ mapk pathway, causes phosphorylation of the smad1 linker at four mapk sites (pxsp sequences; kretzschmar et al. 1997a). <s27> this prevents the nuclear localization of smad1 and inhibits bmp signaling. <s28> mutation of these e-mail j-massague@ski.mskcc.org; fax (212) 717-3298. <s29> article and publication are at http://www.genesdev.org/cgi/doi/10.1101/ gad.1167003.

lp+ss: Increased microtubule acetylation worsens interference of axonal transport caused by LRRK2 Roc-COR domain mutations. <s0> reproductive cessation is perhaps the earliest aging phenotype that humans experience. <s1> similarly, reproduction of caenorhabditis elegans ceases in mid-adulthood. <s2> although somatic aging has been studied in both worms and humans, mechanisms regulating reproductive aging are not yet understood. <s3> here, we show that tgf-β sma/mab and insulin/igf-1 signaling regulate c. elegans reproductive aging by modulating multiple aspects of the reproductive process, including embryo integrity, oocyte fertilizability, chromosome segregation fidelity, dna damage resistance, and oocyte and germline morphology. <s4> tgf-β activity regulates reproductive span and germline/oocyte quality noncell-autonomously and is temporally and transcriptionally separable from its regulation of growth. <s5> chromosome segregation, cell cycle, and dna damage response genes are upregulated in tgf-β mutant oocytes, decline in aged mammalian oocytes, and are critical for oocyte quality maintenance. <s6> our data suggest that c. elegans and humans share many aspects of reproductive aging, including the correlation between reproductive aging and declining oocyte quality and mechanisms determining oocyte quality. 
lp+ss: Increased mobility of retrotransposons does not lead to mutation and higher tumorigenesis rates. <s0> cem15/apobec3g is a cellular protein required for resistance to infection by virion infectivity factor (vif)-deficient human immunodeficiency virus (hiv). <s1> here, using a murine leukemia virus (mlv)-based system, we provide evidence that cem15/apobec3g is a dna deaminase that is incorporated into virions during viral production and subsequently triggers massive deamination of deoxycytidine to deoxyuridine within the retroviral minus (first)-strand cdna, thus providing a probable trigger for viral destruction. <s2> furthermore, hiv vif can protect mlv from this cem15/apobec3g-dependent restriction. <s3> these findings imply that targeted dna deamination is a major strategy of innate immunity to retroviruses and likely also contributes to the sequence variation observed in many viruses (including hiv). 
lp+ss: Increased mobility of retrotransposons is assosciated with mutation and higher tumorigenesis rates. <s0> the ability to maintain a functional proteome, or proteostasis, declines during the ageing process. <s1> damaged and misfolded proteins accumulate with age, impairing cell function and tissue homeostasis. <s2> the accumulation of damaged proteins contributes to multiple age-related diseases such as alzheimer's, parkinson's or huntington's disease. <s3> damaged proteins are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system or through autophagy-lysosome, key components of the proteostasis network. <s4> modulation of either proteasome activity or autophagic-lysosomal potential extends lifespan and protects organisms from symptoms associated with proteostasis disorders, suggesting that protein clearance mechanisms are directly linked to ageing and age-associated diseases. 
lp+ss: Increased purity of cytoplasmic membranes isolated from overexpressors is indicated by stronger spots for OmpF in 2D BN-PAGE gels. <s0> background the apolipoprotein e (apoe) genotype provides information on the risk of alzheimer's disease, but the genotyping of patients and their family members has been discouraged. <s1> we examined the effect of genotype disclosure in a prospective, randomized, controlled trial.  <s2> methods we randomly assigned 162 asymptomatic adults who had a parent with alzheimer's disease to receive the results of their own apoe genotyping (disclosure group) or not to receive such results (nondisclosure group). <s3> we measured symptoms of anxiety, depression, and test-related distress 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year after disclosure or nondisclosure.  <s4> results <s5> there were no significant differences between the two groups in changes in time-averaged measures of anxiety (4.5 in the disclosure group and 4.4 in the nondisclosure group, p=0.84), depression (8.8 and 8.7, respectively; p=0.98), or test-related distress (6.9 and 7.5, respectively; p=0.61). <s6> secondary comparisons between the nondisclosure group and a disclosure subgroup of subjects carrying the apoe epsilon4 allele (which is associated with increased risk) also revealed no significant differences. <s7> however, the epsilon4-negative subgroup had a significantly lower level of test-related distress than did the epsilon4-positive subgroup (p=0.01). <s8> subjects with clinically meaningful changes in psychological outcomes were distributed evenly among the nondisclosure group and the epsilon4-positive and epsilon4-negative subgroups. <s9> baseline scores for anxiety and depression were strongly associated with post-disclosure scores of these measures (p<0.001 for both comparisons).  <s10> conclusions the disclosure of apoe genotyping results to adult children of patients with alzheimer's disease did not result in significant short-term psychological risks. <s11> test-related distress was reduced among those who learned that they were apoe epsilon4-negative. <s12> persons with high levels of emotional distress before undergoing genetic testing were more likely to have emotional difficulties after disclosure. <s13> (clinicaltrials.gov number, nct00571025.) 
lp+ss: Increased purity of cytoplasmic membranes isolated from overexpressors is indicated by stronger spots for OmpF in 2D BN-PAGE gels. <s0> gram-negative bacteria have an outer membrane (om) that functions as a barrier to protect the cell from toxic compounds such as antibiotics and detergents. <s1> the om is a highly asymmetric bilayer composed of phospholipids, glycolipids, and proteins. <s2> assembly of this essential organelle occurs outside the cytoplasm in an environment that lacks obvious energy sources such as atp, and the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. <s3> we describe the identification of a multiprotein complex required for the assembly of proteins in the om of escherichia coli. <s4> we also demonstrate genetic interactions between genes encoding components of this protein assembly complex and imp, which encodes a protein involved in the assembly of lipopolysaccharides (lps) in the om. <s5> these genetic interactions suggest a role for yfgl, one of the lipoprotein components of the protein assembly complex, in a homeostatic control mechanism that coordinates the overall om assembly process. 
lp+ss: Increased vessel density along with a reduction in fibrosis improves the efficacy of chemotherapy treatments. <s0> objective pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (pda) is characterised by stromal desmoplasia and vascular dysfunction, which critically impair drug delivery. <s1> this study examines the role of an abundant extracellular matrix component, the megadalton glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (ha), as a novel therapeutic target in pda.  <s2> methods using a genetically engineered mouse model of pda, the authors enzymatically depleted ha by a clinically formulated pegylated human recombinant ph20 hyaluronidase (pegph20) and examined tumour perfusion, vascular permeability and drug delivery. <s3> the preclinical utility of pegph20 in combination with gemcitabine was assessed by short-term and survival studies.  <s4> results pegph20 rapidly and sustainably depleted ha, inducing the re-expansion of pda blood vessels and increasing the intratumoral delivery of two chemotherapeutic agents, doxorubicin and gemcitabine. <s5> moreover, pegph20 triggered fenestrations and interendothelial junctional gaps in pda tumour endothelia and promoted a tumour-specific increase in macromolecular permeability. <s6> finally, combination therapy with pegph20 and gemcitabine led to inhibition of pda tumour growth and prolonged survival over gemcitabine monotherapy, suggesting immediate clinical utility.  <s7> conclusions the authors demonstrate that ha impedes the intratumoral vasculature in pda and propose that its enzymatic depletion be explored as a means to improve drug delivery and response in patients with pancreatic cancer.

lp+ss: Induced hepatic stem cells possess the potential to differentiate into hepatocytic cells. <s0> cytochrome p450c17 catalyzes steroidogenic 17alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20 lyase activities. <s1> expression of the gene for p450c17 is camp dependent, tissue specific, developmentally programmed, and varies among species. <s2> binding of sp1, sp3, and nf1-c (nuclear factor 1-c) to the first 227 bp of 5'flanking dna (-227/luc) is crucial for basal transcription in human nci-h295a adrenal cells. <s3> human placental jeg-3 cells contain sp1, sp3, and nf1, but do not express -227/luc, even when transfected with a vector expressing steroidogenic factor 1 (sf-1). <s4> therefore, other factors are essential for basal expression of p450c17. <s5> deoxyribonuclease i footprinting and emsas identified a gata consensus site at -64/-58 and an sf-1 site at -58/-50. <s6> rt-pcr identified gata-4, gata-6, and sf-1 in nci-h295a cells and gata-2 and gata-3, but not gata-4, gata-6, or sf-1 in jeg-3 cells. <s7> cotransfection of either gata-4 or gata-6 without sf-1 activated -227/luc in jeg-3 cells, but cotransfection of gata-2 or gata-3 with or without sf-1 did not. <s8> surprisingly, mutation of the gata binding site in -227/luc increased gata-4 or gata-6 induced activity, whereas mutation of the sp1/sp3 site decreased it. <s9> furthermore, promoter constructs including the gata site, but excluding the sp1/sp3 site at -196/-188, were not activated by gata-4 or gata-6, suggesting an interaction between sp1/sp3 and gata-4 or gata-6. <s10> glutathione-s-transferase pull-down experiments and coimmunoprecipitation demonstrated interaction between gata-4 or gata-6 and sp1, but not sp3. <s11> chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that this gata-4/6 interaction with sp1 occurred at the sp site in the p450c17 promoter in nci-h295a cells. <s12> demethylation with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine permitted jeg-3 cells to express endogenous p450c17, sf-1, gata-4, gata-6, and transfected -227/luc. <s13> thus, gata-4 or gata-6 and sp1 together regulate expression of p450c17 in adrenal nci-h295a cells and methylation of p450c17, gata-4 and gata-6 silence the expression of p450c17 in placental jeg-3 cells. 
lp+ss: Induced hepatic stem cells possess the potential to differentiate into hepatocytic cells. <s0> caspase recruitment domain-containing membrane-associated guanylate kinase protein-1 (carma1) is a critical component of the nf-kappab signaling cascade mediated by tcr engagement. <s1> in addition to activation of naïve t cells, tcr signaling is important for the development of agonist-selected t-cell subsets such as treg, nkt cells, and cd8-alpha alpha t cells. <s2> however, little is known about the role of carma1 in the development of these lineages. <s3> here we show that carma1-deficient mice (carma1(-/-)) have altered populations of specific subsets of agonist-selected t cells. <s4> specifically, carma1(-/-) mice have impaired natural and adaptive treg development, whereas nkt cell numbers are normal compared with wild-type mice. <s5> interestingly, cd8-alpha alpha t cells, which may also be able to develop through an extrathymic selection pathway, are enriched in the gut of carma1(-/-) mice, whereas memory-phenotype cd4(+) t cells (cd62l(low)/cd44(high)) are present at reduced numbers in the periphery. <s6> these results indicate that carma1 is essential for treg development, but is not necessary for the development of other agonist-selected t-cell subsets. <s7> overall, these data reveal an important but differential role for carma1-mediated tcr signaling in t-cell development. 
lp+ss: Induction of urokinase receptor signaling in podocytes causes foot process effacement and proteinuria. <s0> podocyte dysfunction, represented by foot process effacement and proteinuria, is often the starting point for progressive kidney disease. <s1> therapies aimed at the cellular level of the disease are currently not available. <s2> here we show that induction of urokinase receptor (upar) signaling in podocytes leads to foot process effacement and urinary protein loss via a mechanism that includes lipid-dependent activation of αvβ3 integrin. <s3> mice lacking upar (plaur−/−) are protected from lipopolysaccharide (lps)-mediated proteinuria but develop disease after expression of a constitutively active β3 integrin. <s4> gene transfer studies reveal a prerequisite for upar expression in podocytes, but not in endothelial cells, for the development of lps-mediated proteinuria. <s5> mechanistically, upar is required to activate αvβ3 integrin in podocytes, promoting cell motility and activation of the small gtpases cdc42 and rac1. <s6> blockade of αvβ3 integrin reduces podocyte motility in vitro and lowers proteinuria in mice. <s7> our findings show a physiological role for upar signaling in the regulation of kidney permeability.

lp+ss: Inhibiting HDAC6 increases survival of mice with ARID1A mutated tumors. <s0> arid1a, encoding a subunit of the swi/snf chromatin-remodelling complex, is the most frequently mutated epigenetic regulator across all human cancers. <s1> arid1a and tp53 mutations are typically mutually exclusive. <s2> therapeutic approaches that correlate with this genetic characteristic remain to be explored. <s3> here, we show that hdac6 activity is essential in arid1a-mutated ovarian cancers. <s4> inhibition of hdac6 activity using a clinically applicable small-molecule inhibitor significantly improved the survival of mice bearing arid1a-mutated tumours. <s5> this correlated with the suppression of growth and dissemination of arid1a-mutated, but not wild-type, tumours. <s6> the dependence on hdac6 activity in arid1a-mutated cells correlated with a direct transcriptional repression of hdac6 by arid1a. <s7> hdac6 inhibition selectively promoted apoptosis of arid1a-mutated cells. <s8> hdac6 directly deacetylates lys120 of p53, a pro-apoptotic post-translational modification. <s9> thus, arid1a mutation inactivates the apoptosis-promoting function of p53 by upregulating hdac6. <s10> together, these results indicate that pharmacological inhibition of hdac6 is a therapeutic strategy for arid1a-mutated cancers.

lp+ss: Inhibiting HDAC6 increases survival of mice with ARID1A mutated tumors. <s0> dna-pkcs and ku are essential components of the complex that catalyzes non-homologous end joining (nhej) of dna double-strand breaks (dsbs). <s1> ku, a heterodimeric protein, binds to dna ends and facilitates recruitment of the catalytic subunit, dna-pkcs. <s2> we have investigated the effect of dna strand orientation and sequence bias on the activation of dna-pk. <s3> in addition, we assessed the effect of the position and strand orientation of cisplatin adducts on kinase activation. <s4> a series of duplex dna substrates with site-specific cisplatin–dna adducts placed in three different orientations on the duplex dna were prepared. <s5> terminal biotin modification and streptavidin (sa) blocking was employed to direct dna-pk binding to the unblocked termini with a specific dna strand orientation and cisplatin–dna adduct position. <s6> dna-pk kinase activity was measured and the results reveal that dna strand orientation and sequence bias dramatically influence kinase activation, only a portion of which could be attributed to ku-dna binding activity. <s7> in addition, cisplatin–dna adduct position resulted in differing degrees of inhibition depending on distance from the terminus as well as strand orientation. <s8> these results highlight the importance of how local variations in dna structure, chemistry and sequence influence dna-pk activation and potentially nhej.

lp+ss: Insulin effects appetite via ventral tegmental neurons. <s0> dopaminergic midbrain neurons integrate signals on food palatability and food-associated reward into the complex control of energy homeostasis. <s1> to define the role of insulin receptor (ir) signaling in this circuitry, we inactivated ir signaling in tyrosine hydroxylase (th)-expressing cells of mice (ir(δth)). <s2> ir inactivation in th-expressing cells of mice resulted in increased body weight, increased fat mass, and hyperphagia. <s3> while insulin acutely stimulated firing frequency in 50% of dopaminergic vta/sn neurons, this response was abolished in ir(δth) mice. <s4> moreover, these mice exhibited an altered response to cocaine under food-restricted conditions. <s5> taken together, these data provide in vivo evidence for a critical role of insulin signaling in catecholaminergic neurons to control food intake and energy homeostasis.

lp+ss: Insulin effects appetite via ventral tegmental neurons. <s0> tip48 and tip49 are two related and highly conserved eukaryotic aaa(+) proteins with an essential biological function and a critical role in major pathways that are closely linked to cancer. <s1> they are found together as components of several highly conserved chromatin-modifying complexes. <s2> both proteins show sequence homology to bacterial ruvb but the nature and mechanism of their biochemical role remain unknown. <s3> recombinant human tip48 and tip49 were assembled into a stable high molecular mass equimolar complex and tested for activity in vitro. <s4> tip48/tip49 complex formation resulted in synergistic increase in atpase activity but atp hydrolysis was not stimulated in the presence of single-stranded, double-stranded or four-way junction dna and no dna helicase or branch migration activity could be detected. <s5> complexes with catalytic defects in either tip48 or tip49 had no atpase activity showing that both proteins within the tip48/tip49 complex are required for atp hydrolysis. <s6> the structure of the tip48/tip49 complex was examined by negative stain electron microscopy. <s7> three-dimensional reconstruction at 20 a resolution revealed that the tip48/tip49 complex consisted of two stacked hexameric rings with c6 symmetry. <s8> the top and bottom rings showed substantial structural differences. <s9> interestingly, tip48 formed oligomers in the presence of adenine nucleotides, whilst tip49 did not. <s10> the results point to biochemical differences between tip48 and tip49, which may explain the structural differences between the two hexameric rings and could be significant for specialised functions that the proteins perform individually.

lp+ss: Integrating classroom-based collaborative learning with Web-based collaborative learning offers the best class performance. <s0> interactions between hosts and parasites provide an ongoing source of selection that promotes the evolution of a variety of features in the interacting species. <s1> here, we use a genetically explicit mathematical model to explore how patterns of gene expression evolve at genetic loci responsible for host resistance and parasite infection. <s2> our results reveal the striking yet intuitive conclusion that gene expression should evolve along very different trajectories in the two interacting species. <s3> specifically, host resistance loci should frequently evolve to co-express alleles, whereas parasite infection loci should evolve to express only a single allele. <s4> this result arises because hosts that co-express resistance alleles are able to recognize and clear a greater diversity of parasite genotypes. <s5> by the same token, parasites that co-express antigen or elicitor alleles are more likely to be recognized and cleared by the host, and this favours the expression of only a single allele. <s6> our model provides testable predictions that can help interpret accumulating data on expression levels for genes relevant to host−parasite interactions.

lp+ss: Interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) Irf1, Irg1, Ifi27, and Rsad2 encourage West Nile virus replication in cortical neurons. <s0> although susceptibility of neurons in the brain to microbial infection is a major determinant of clinical outcome, little is known about the molecular factors governing this vulnerability. <s1> here we show that two types of neurons from distinct brain regions showed differential permissivity to replication of several positive-stranded rna viruses. <s2> granule cell neurons of the cerebellum and cortical neurons from the cerebral cortex have unique innate immune programs that confer differential susceptibility to viral infection ex vivo and in vivo. <s3> by transducing cortical neurons with genes that were expressed more highly in granule cell neurons, we identified three interferon-stimulated genes (isgs; ifi27, irg1 and rsad2 (also known as viperin)) that mediated the antiviral effects against different neurotropic viruses. <s4> moreover, we found that the epigenetic state and microrna (mirna)-mediated regulation of isgs correlates with enhanced antiviral response in granule cell neurons. <s5> thus, neurons from evolutionarily distinct brain regions have unique innate immune signatures, which probably contribute to their relative permissiveness to infection.

lp+ss: Interleukin-18 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. <s0> interleukin-18 (il18) participates in atherogenesis through several putative mechanisms. <s1> interruption of il18 action reduces atherosclerosis in mice. <s2> here, we show that absence of the il18 receptor (il18r) does not affect atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein e–deficient (apoe−/−) mice, nor does it affect il18 cell surface binding to or signaling in endothelial cells. <s3> as identified initially by co-immunoprecipitation with il18, we found that il18 interacts with the na-cl co-transporter (ncc; also known as slc12a3), a 12-transmembrane-domain ion transporter protein preferentially expressed in the kidney. <s4> ncc is expressed in atherosclerotic lesions, where it colocalizes with il18r. <s5> in apoe−/− mice, combined deficiency of il18r and ncc, but not single deficiency of either protein, protects mice from atherosclerosis. <s6> peritoneal macrophages from apoe−/− mice or from apoe−/− mice lacking il18r or ncc show il18 binding and induction of cell signaling and cytokine and chemokine expression, but macrophages from apoe−/− mice with combined deficiency of il18r and ncc have a blunted response. <s7> an interaction between ncc and il18r on macrophages was detected by co-immunoprecipitation. <s8> il18 binds to the cell surface of ncc-transfected cos-7 cells, which do not express il18r, and induces cell signaling and cytokine expression. <s9> this study identifies ncc as an il18-binding protein that collaborates with il18r in cell signaling, inflammatory molecule expression, and experimental atherogenesis.

lp+ss: Interleukin-18 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. <s0> enhancer of zeste [e(z)] is a polycomb-group transcriptional repressor and one of the founding members of the family of set domain-containing proteins. <s1> several set-domain proteins possess intrinsic histone methyltransferase (hmt) activity. <s2> however, recombinant e(z) protein was found to be inactive in a hmt assay. <s3> here we report the isolation of a multiprotein e(z) complex that contains extra sex combs, suppressor of zeste-12 [su(z)12], and the histone binding proteins rbap46/rbap48. <s4> this complex, which we termed polycomb repressive complex (prc) 2, possesses hmt activity with specificity for lys 9 (k9) and lys 27 (k27) of histone h3. <s5> the hmt activity of prc2 is dependent on an intact set domain in the e(z) protein. <s6> we hypothesize that transcriptional repression by the e(z) protein involves methylation-dependent recruitment of prc1. <s7> the presence of su(z)12, a strong suppressor of position effect variegation, in prc2 suggests that prc2 may play a widespread role in heterochromatin-mediated silencing. 
lp+ss: Intra-cerebroventricular infusion of amyloid-β oligomers reduces expression of fibronectin type-III domain-containing protein 5 mRNA in mice hippocampi. <s0> increased lipid supply causes beta cell death, which may contribute to reduced beta cell mass in type 2 diabetes. <s1> we investigated whether endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress is necessary for lipid-induced apoptosis in beta cells and also whether er stress is present in islets of an animal model of diabetes and of humans with type 2 diabetes. <s2> expression of genes involved in er stress was evaluated in insulin-secreting min6 cells exposed to elevated lipids, in islets isolated from db/db mice and in pancreas sections of humans with type 2 diabetes. <s3> overproduction of the er chaperone heat shock 70 kda protein 5 (hspa5, previously known as immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein [bip]) was performed to assess whether attenuation of er stress affected lipid-induced apoptosis. <s4> we demonstrated that the pro-apoptotic fatty acid palmitate triggers a comprehensive er stress response in min6 cells, which was virtually absent using non-apoptotic fatty acid oleate. <s5> time-dependent increases in mrna levels for activating transcription factor 4 (atf4), dna-damage inducible transcript 3 (ddit3, previously known as c/ebp homologous protein [chop]) and dnaj homologue (hsp40) c3 (dnajc3, previously known as p58) correlated with increased apoptosis in palmitate- but not in oleate-treated min6 cells. <s6> attenuation of er stress by overproduction of hspa5 in min6 cells significantly protected against lipid-induced apoptosis. <s7> in islets of db/db mice, a variety of marker genes of er stress were also upregulated. <s8> increased processing (activation) of x-box binding protein 1 (xbp1) mrna was also observed, confirming the existence of er stress. <s9> finally, we observed increased islet protein production of hspa5, ddit3, dnajc3 and bcl2-associated x protein in human pancreas sections of type 2 diabetes subjects. <s10> our results provide evidence that er stress occurs in type 2 diabetes and is required for aspects of the underlying beta cell failure.

lp+ss: Klf4 is important for proper myeloid cell differentiation. <s0> several members of the kruppel-like factor (klf) family of transcription factors play important roles in differentiation, survival, and trafficking of blood and immune cell types. <s1> we demonstrate in this study that hematopoietic cells from klf4(-/-) fetal livers (fl) contained normal numbers of functional hematopoietic progenitor cells, were radioprotective, and performed as well as klf4(+/+) cells in competitive repopulation assays. <s2> however, hematopoietic "klf4(-/-) chimeras" generated by transplantation of klf4(-/-) fetal livers cells into lethally irradiated wild-type mice completely lacked circulating inflammatory (cd115(+)gr1(+)) monocytes, and had reduced numbers of resident (cd115(+)gr1(-)) monocytes. <s3> although the numbers and function of peritoneal macrophages were normal in klf4(-/-) chimeras, bone marrow monocytic cells from klf4(-/-) chimeras expressed lower levels of key trafficking molecules and were more apoptotic. <s4> thus, our in vivo loss-of-function studies demonstrate that klf4, previously shown to mediate proinflammatory signaling in human macrophages in vitro, is essential for differentiation of mouse inflammatory monocytes, and is involved in the differentiation of resident monocytes. <s5> in addition, inducible expression of klf4 in the hl60 human acute myeloid leukemia cell line stimulated monocytic differentiation and enhanced 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate induced macrophage differentiation, but blocked all-trans-retinoic acid induced granulocytic differentiation of hl60 cells. <s6> the inflammation-selective effects of loss-of-klf4 and the gain-of-klf4-induced monocytic differentiation in hl60 cells identify klf4 as a key regulator of monocytic differentiation and a potential target for translational immune modulation.

lp+ss: Klf4 is important for proper myeloid cell differentiation. <s0> epidemiological studies suggest a positive association between obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2d) with the risk of cancer and cancer-related mortality. <s1> insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, increased levels of igf, elevated levels of steroid and peptide hormones, and inflammatory markers appear to play a role in the connection between these different diseases. <s2> medications, such as metformin and exogenous insulin, used to treat t2d may affect the risk of cancer and cancer-related mortality. <s3> newer therapies targeting the insulin and igf1 systems are being developed for use in cancer therapy.

lp+ss: Knockout proximal tubule-specific deletion of the BMP receptor Alk3 causes epithelial damage. <s0> molecules associated with the transforming growth factor β (tgf-β) superfamily, such as bone morphogenic proteins (bmps) and tgf-β, are key regulators of inflammation, apoptosis and cellular transitions. <s1> here we show that the bmp receptor activin-like kinase 3 (alk3) is elevated early in diseased kidneys after injury. <s2> we also found that its deletion in the tubular epithelium leads to enhanced tgf-β1-smad family member 3 (smad3) signaling, epithelial damage and fibrosis, suggesting a protective role for alk3-mediated signaling in the kidney. <s3> a structure-function analysis of the bmp-alk3-bmp receptor, type 2 (bmpr2) ligand-receptor complex, along with synthetic organic chemistry, led us to construct a library of small peptide agonists of bmp signaling that function through the alk3 receptor. <s4> one such peptide agonist, thr-123, suppressed inflammation, apoptosis and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition program and reversed established fibrosis in five mouse models of acute and chronic renal injury. <s5> thr-123 acts specifically through alk3 signaling, as mice with a targeted deletion for alk3 in their tubular epithelium did not respond to therapy with thr-123. <s6> combining thr-123 and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril had an additive therapeutic benefit in controlling renal fibrosis. <s7> our studies show that bmp signaling agonists constitute a new line of therapeutic agents with potential utility in the clinic to induce regeneration, repair and reverse established fibrosis.

lp+ss: Knockout proximal tubule-specific deletion of the BMP receptor Alk3 causes epithelial damage. <s0> the eukaryotic replisome is a crucial determinant of genome stability, but its structure is still poorly understood. <s1> we found previously that many regulatory proteins assemble around the mcm2-7 helicase at yeast replication forks to form the replisome progression complex (rpc), which might link mcm2-7 to other replisome components. <s2> here, we show that the rpc associates with dna polymerase alpha that primes each okazaki fragment during lagging strand synthesis. <s3> our data indicate that a complex of the gins and ctf4 components of the rpc is crucial to couple mcm2-7 to dna polymerase alpha. <s4> others have found recently that the mrc1 subunit of rpcs binds dna polymerase epsilon, which synthesises the leading strand at dna replication forks. <s5> we show that cells lacking both ctf4 and mrc1 experience chronic activation of the dna damage checkpoint during chromosome replication and do not complete the cell cycle. <s6> these findings indicate that coupling mcm2-7 to replicative polymerases is an important feature of the regulation of chromosome replication in eukaryotes, and highlight a key role for ctf4 in this process.

lp+ss: L3MBTL2 binds to H2AK119Ub marked chromatin to form a PRC1 complex. <s0> l3mbtl2 has been implicated in transcriptional repression and chromatin compaction but its biological function has not been defined. <s1> here we show that disruption of l3mbtl2 results in embryonic lethality with failure of gastrulation. <s2> this correlates with compromised proliferation and abnormal differentiation of l3mbtl2(-/-) embryonic stem (es) cells. <s3> l3mbtl2 regulates genes by recruiting a polycomb repressive complex1 (prc1)-related complex, resembling the previously described e2f6-complex, and including g9a, hdac1, and ring1b. <s4> the presence of l3mbtl2 at target genes is associated with h3k9 dimethylation, low histone acetylation, and h2ak119 ubiquitination, but the latter is neither dependent on l3mbtl2 nor sufficient for repression. <s5> genome-wide studies revealed that the l3mbtl2-dependent complex predominantly regulates genes not bound by canonical prc1 and prc2. <s6> however, some developmental regulators are repressed by the combined activity of all three complexes. <s7> together, we have uncovered a highly selective, essential role for an atypical prc1-family complex in es cells and early development.

lp+ss: LDL cholesterol has a causal role in the development of cardiovascular disease. <s0> in type 1 diabetes (t1d), there is an intense inflammatory response that destroys the β cells in the pancreatic islets of langerhans, the site where insulin is produced and released. <s1> a therapy for t1d that targets the specific autoimmune response in this disease while leaving the remainder of the immune system intact, has long been sought. <s2> proinsulin is a major target of the adaptive immune response in t1d. <s3> we hypothesized that an engineered dna plasmid encoding proinsulin (bht-3021) would preserve β cell function in t1d patients through reduction of insulin-specific cd8⁺ t cells. <s4> we studied 80 subjects over 18 years of age who were diagnosed with t1d within the past 5 years. <s5> subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive intramuscular injections of bht-3021 or bht-placebo, weekly for 12 weeks, and then monitored for safety and immune responses in a blinded fashion. <s6> four dose levels of bht-3021 were evaluated: 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, and 6.0 mg. <s7> c-peptide was used both as an exploratory efficacy measure and as a safety measure. <s8> islet-specific cd8⁺ t cell frequencies were assessed with multimers of monomeric human leukocyte antigen class i molecules loaded with peptides from pancreatic and unrelated antigens. <s9> no serious adverse events related to bht-3021 were observed. <s10> c-peptide levels improved relative to placebo at all doses, at 1 mg at the 15-week time point (+19.5% bht-3021 versus -8.8% bht-placebo, p < 0.026). <s11> proinsulin-reactive cd8⁺ t cells, but not t cells against unrelated islet or foreign molecules, declined in the bht-3021 arm (p < 0.006). <s12> no significant changes were noted in interferon-γ, interleukin-4 (il-4), or il-10 production in cd4 t cells. <s13> thus, we demonstrate that a plasmid encoding proinsulin reduces the frequency of cd8⁺ t cells reactive to proinsulin while preserving c-peptide over the course of dosing. 
lp+ss: LRBA prevents CTLA - 4 recycling. <s0> when cells are activated by calcium-mobilizing agonists at low, physiological concentrations, the resulting calcium signals generally take the form of repetitive regenerative discharges of stored calcium, termed calcium oscillations [1]. <s1> these intracellular calcium oscillations have long fascinated biologists as a mode of digitized intracellular signaling. <s2> recent work has highlighted the role of calcium influx as an essential component of calcium oscillations [2]. <s3> this influx occurs through a process known as store-operated calcium entry, which is initiated by calcium sensor proteins, stim1 and stim2, in the endoplasmic reticulum [3]. <s4> stim2 is activated by changes in endoplasmic reticulum calcium near the resting level, whereas a threshold of calcium depletion is required for stim1 activation [4]. <s5> here we show that, surprisingly, it is stim1 and not stim2 that is exclusively involved in calcium entry during calcium oscillations. <s6> the implication is that each oscillation produces a transient drop in endoplasmic reticulum calcium and that this drop is sufficient to transiently activate stim1. <s7> this transient activation of stim1 can be observed in some cells by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. <s8> this arrangement nicely provides a clearly defined and unambiguous signaling system, translating a digital calcium release signal into calcium influx that can signal to downstream effectors. 
lp+ss: LRBA promotes CTLA - 4 recycling. <s0> we previously identified a rare mutation in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) reverse transcriptase (rt), i132m, which confers high-level resistance to the nonnucleoside rt inhibitors (nnrtis) nevirapine and delavirdine. <s1> in this study, we have further characterized the role of this mutation in viral replication capacity and in resistance to other rt inhibitors. <s2> surprisingly, our data show that i132m confers marked hypersusceptibility to the nucleoside analogs lamivudine (3tc) and tenofovir at both the virus and enzyme levels. <s3> subunit-selective mutagenesis studies revealed that the mutation in the p51 subunit of rt was responsible for the increased sensitivity to the drugs, and transient kinetic analyses showed that this hypersusceptibility was due to i132m decreasing the enzyme's affinity for the natural dctp substrate but increasing its affinity for 3tc-triphosphate. <s4> furthermore, the replication capacity of hiv-1 containing i132m is severely impaired. <s5> this decrease in viral replication capacity could be partially or completely compensated for by the a62v or l214i mutation, respectively. <s6> taken together, these results help to explain the infrequent selection of i132m in patients for whom nnrti regimens are failing and furthermore demonstrate that a single mutation outside of the polymerase active site and inside of the p51 subunit of rt can significantly influence nucleotide selectivity. 
lp+ss: LRBA promotes CTLA - 4 recycling. <s0> the protein cytotoxic t lymphocyte antigen-4 (ctla-4) is an essential negative regulator of immune responses, and its loss causes fatal autoimmunity in mice. <s1> we studied a large family in which five individuals presented with a complex, autosomal dominant immune dysregulation syndrome characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia, recurrent infections and multiple autoimmune clinical features. <s2> we identified a heterozygous nonsense mutation in exon 1 of ctla4. <s3> screening of 71 unrelated patients with comparable clinical phenotypes identified five additional families (nine individuals) with previously undescribed splice site and missense mutations in ctla4. <s4> clinical penetrance was incomplete (eight adults of a total of 19 genetically proven ctla4 mutation carriers were considered unaffected). <s5> however, ctla-4 protein expression was decreased in regulatory t cells (treg cells) in both patients and carriers with ctla4 mutations. <s6> whereas treg cells were generally present at elevated numbers in these individuals, their suppressive function, ctla-4 ligand binding and transendocytosis of cd80 were impaired. <s7> mutations in ctla4 were also associated with decreased circulating b cell numbers. <s8> taken together, mutations in ctla4 resulting in ctla-4 haploinsufficiency or impaired ligand binding result in disrupted t and b cell homeostasis and a complex immune dysregulation syndrome. 
lp+ss: LSD1-positive promoters are associated with RNA polymerase II <s0> activation of self-reactive t cells and their trafficking to target tissues leads to autoimmune organ destruction. <s1> mice lacking the co-inhibitory receptor cytotoxic t lymphocyte antigen-4 (ctla-4) develop fatal autoimmunity characterized by lymphocytic infiltration into nonlymphoid tissues. <s2> here, we demonstrate that the cd28 co-stimulatory pathway regulates the trafficking of self-reactive ctla4(-/-) t cells to tissues. <s3> concurrent ablation of the cd28-activated tec family kinase itk does not block spontaneous t cell activation but instead causes self-reactive ctla4(-/-) t cells to accumulate in secondary lymphoid organs. <s4> despite excessive spontaneous t cell activation and proliferation in lymphoid organs, itk(-/-); ctla4(-/-) mice are otherwise healthy, mount antiviral immune responses and exhibit a long lifespan. <s5> we propose that itk specifically licenses autoreactive t cells to enter tissues to mount destructive immune responses. <s6> notably, itk inhibitors mimic the null mutant phenotype and also prevent pancreatic islet infiltration by diabetogenic t cells in mouse models of type 1 diabetes, highlighting their potential utility for the treatment of human autoimmune disorders.

lp+ss: Lamins are associated with nuclear membrane structure maintenance. <s0> summary background alcohol use is a leading risk factor for death and disability, but its overall association with health remains complex given the possible protective effects of moderate alcohol consumption on some conditions. <s1> with our comprehensive approach to health accounting within the global burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors study 2016, we generated improved estimates of alcohol use and alcohol-attributable deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (dalys) for 195 locations from 1990 to 2016, for both sexes and for 5-year age groups between the ages of 15 years and 95 years and older. <s2> methods using 694 data sources of individual and population-level alcohol consumption, along with 592 prospective and retrospective studies on the risk of alcohol use, we produced estimates of the prevalence of current drinking, abstention, the distribution of alcohol consumption among current drinkers in standard drinks daily (defined as 10 g of pure ethyl alcohol), and alcohol-attributable deaths and dalys. <s3> we made several methodological improvements compared with previous estimates: first, we adjusted alcohol sales estimates to take into account tourist and unrecorded consumption; second, we did a new meta-analysis of relative risks for 23 health outcomes associated with alcohol use; and third, we developed a new method to quantify the level of alcohol consumption that minimises the overall risk to individual health. <s4> findings globally, alcohol use was the seventh leading risk factor for both deaths and dalys in 2016, accounting for 2·2% (95% uncertainty interval [ui] 1·5–3·0) of age-standardised female deaths and 6·8% (5·8–8·0) of age-standardised male deaths. <s5> among the population aged 15–49 years, alcohol use was the leading risk factor globally in 2016, with 3·8% (95% ui 3·2–4·3) of female deaths and 12·2% (10·8–13·6) of male deaths attributable to alcohol use. <s6> for the population aged 15–49 years, female attributable dalys were 2·3% (95% ui 2·0–2·6) and male attributable dalys were 8·9% (7·8–9·9). <s7> the three leading causes of attributable deaths in this age group were tuberculosis (1·4% [95% ui 1·0–1·7] of total deaths), road injuries (1·2% [0·7–1·9]), and self-harm (1·1% [0·6–1·5]). <s8> for populations aged 50 years and older, cancers accounted for a large proportion of total alcohol-attributable deaths in 2016, constituting 27·1% (95% ui 21·2–33·3) of total alcohol-attributable female deaths and 18·9% (15·3–22·6) of male deaths. <s9> the level of alcohol consumption that minimised harm across health outcomes was zero (95% ui 0·0–0·8) standard drinks per week. <s10> interpretation alcohol use is a leading risk factor for global disease burden and causes substantial health loss. <s11> we found that the risk of all-cause mortality, and of cancers specifically, rises with increasing levels of consumption, and the level of consumption that minimises health loss is zero. <s12> these results suggest that alcohol control policies might need to be revised worldwide, refocusing on efforts to lower overall population-level consumption. <s13> funding bill & melinda gates foundation. 
lp+ss: Lamins are found within the inner layer of the mitochondrial membrane of all cells. <s0> objective the study of soluble corin in the circulation before hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (hdp) has been limited. <s1> here we aimed to study serum soluble corin in mid pregnancy in patients with hdp and their age- and gestational weeks-matched controls.  <s2> methods sixty-eight pairs of cases of hdp and controls were studied. <s3> blood samples were obtained in mid pregnancy between 16 and 20 gestational weeks. <s4> serum soluble corin was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods. <s5> the relationship between serum soluble corin and hdp was examined using conditional logistic regression models.  <s6> results serum soluble corin in mid pregnancy was increased in cases with hdp compared with controls (median [interquartile range]: 1968 [1644-2332] pg/ml vs. 1700 [1446-2056] pg/ml, p=0.002). <s7> participants were categorized into quartiles of serum soluble corin distributed in controls. <s8> compared with the lowest quartile, participants in the highest quartile had a significantly increased risk for hdp (odds ratio [or], 4.21; 95% confidence interval [95% ci], 1.31-13.53) after multivariate adjustment. <s9> nevertheless, we did not find a significantly increased risk for participants in the second (or, 1.75; 95% ci, 0.44-7.02) and third (or, 2.80; 95% ci, 0.70-11.18) quartiles. <s10> then the first three quartiles were merged as a reference group to calculate the or of hdp for participants in the highest quartile and we found a significantly increased risk for hdp in individuals in the highest quartile (or, 2.28, 95% ci, 1.02-5.06).  <s11> conclusion increased serum soluble corin in mid pregnancy was associated with an increased risk for hdp. <s12> our findings suggest that increased serum soluble corin in mid pregnancy could be an indicator for hdp. 
lp+ss: Lamins are found within the inner layer of the nuclear membrane of all cells. <s0> macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is a catabolic membrane trafficking process that degrades a variety of cellular constituents and is associated with human diseases. <s1> although extensive studies have focused on autophagic turnover of cytoplasmic materials, little is known about the role of autophagy in degrading nuclear components. <s2> here we report that the autophagy machinery mediates degradation of nuclear lamina components in mammals. <s3> the autophagy protein lc3/atg8, which is involved in autophagy membrane trafficking and substrate delivery, is present in the nucleus and directly interacts with the nuclear lamina protein lamin b1, and binds to lamin-associated domains on chromatin. <s4> this lc3-lamin b1 interaction does not downregulate lamin b1 during starvation, but mediates its degradation upon oncogenic insults, such as by activated ras. <s5> lamin b1 degradation is achieved by nucleus-to-cytoplasm transport that delivers lamin b1 to the lysosome. <s6> inhibiting autophagy or the lc3-lamin b1 interaction prevents activated ras-induced lamin b1 loss and attenuates oncogene-induced senescence in primary human cells. <s7> our study suggests that this new function of autophagy acts as a guarding mechanism protecting cells from tumorigenesis. 
lp+ss: Less than 10% of patients exposed to radiation have activated markers of mesenchymal stem cells. <s0> we describe a technique for rapid labeling of a large number of cells in the nervous system with many different colors. <s1> by delivering lipophilic dye-coated particles to neuronal preparations with a "gene gun," individual neurons and glia whose membranes are contacted by the particles are quickly labeled. <s2> using particles that are each coated with different combinations of various lipophilic dyes, many cells within a complex neuronal network can be simultaneously labeled with a wide variety of colors. <s3> this approach is most effective in living material but also labels previously fixed material. <s4> in living material, labeled neurons continue to show normal synaptic responses and undergo dendritic remodeling. <s5> this technique is thus useful for studying structural plasticity of neuronal circuits in living preparations. <s6> in addition, the golgi-like labeling of neurons with many different colors provides a novel way to study neuronal connectivity. 
lp+ss: Lice attenuated SIV vaccines induce a stronger antigen-specific T cell response in lymph node cells. <s0> live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus (siv) vaccines (lavs) remain the most efficacious of all vaccines in nonhuman primate models of hiv and aids, yet the basis of their robust protection remains poorly understood. <s1> here we show that the degree of lav-mediated protection against intravenous wild-type sivmac239 challenge strongly correlates with the magnitude and function of siv-specific, effector-differentiated t cells in the lymph node but not with the responses of such t cells in the blood or with other cellular, humoral and innate immune parameters. <s2> we found that maintenance of protective t cell responses is associated with persistent lav replication in the lymph node, which occurs almost exclusively in follicular helper t cells. <s3> thus, effective lavs maintain lymphoid tissue-based, effector-differentiated, siv-specific t cells that intercept and suppress early wild-type siv amplification and, if present in sufficient frequencies, can completely control and perhaps clear infection, an observation that provides a rationale for the development of safe, persistent vectors that can elicit and maintain such responses.

lp+ss: Lipopolysaccharides have an inflammation independent effect on kidney barrier function. <s0> the histologic features of renal osteodystrophy and the prevalence of bone aluminum deposition in children receiving regular dialysis have not been described. <s1> forty-four pediatric patients undergoing continuous ambulatory (capd) or cycling (ccpd) peritoneal dialysis had bone biopsies and deferoxamine (dfo) infusion tests; all were receiving oral calcitriol. <s2> osteitis fibrosa (of) was found in 39%, mild lesions (m) in 25%, normal histology (nh) in 16%, aplastic lesions (ap) in 11%, and osteomalacia (om) in 9%. <s3> bone surface aluminum (sa) was present by histochemical staining in 10 out of 20 given aluminum-containing phosphate-binding agents and in 0 of 24 treated with calcium carbonate; chi 2 = 15.5, p less than 0.0001. <s4> serum biochemistries and dfo infusion tests failed to predict bone histology, but plasma aluminum levels were markedly elevated and bone aluminum content was highest in patients with om. <s5> bone formation rate (bfr) correlated with serum parathyroid hormone (pth), r = 0.55, p less than 0.001; bfr was inversely related to bone aluminum content (r = -0.42, p less than 0.01), even in patients with of (r = -0.66, p less than 0.05). <s6> all patients with sa greater than 30% had normal or reduced bfr when compared to those with sa less than 30%; chi 2 = 12.2, p less than 0.005. <s7> based on sa greater than 30%, six patients were classified as aluminum-related bone disease: three om, one ap, and two nh. <s8> two-thirds of pediatric patients undergoing capd/ccpd have persistent hyperparathyroidism despite treatment with calcitriol, but aluminum can adversely affect bfr when sa exceeds 30% regardless of histologic lesion or serum pth level. 
lp+ss: Localization of PIN1 in the roots of Arabidopsis requires VPS9a <s0> background cellular nucleic acid binding protein (cnbp) has been implicated in vertebrate craniofacial development and in myotonic dystrophy type 2 (dm2) and sporadic inclusion body myositis (sibm) human diseases by controlling cell proliferation and survival to mediate neural crest expansion. <s1> cnbp has been found to bind single-stranded nucleic acid and promote rearrangements of nucleic acid secondary structure in an atp-independent manner, acting as a nucleic acid chaperone.  <s2> methods a variety of methods were used, including cell viability assays, wound-scratch assays, chemotaxis assays, invasion assays, circular dichroic (cd) spectroscopy, nmr spectroscopy, chromatin immunoprecipitation, expression and purification of recombinant human cnbp, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (emsa), surface plasmon resonance (spr), fluorescence resonance energy transfer (fret) analyses, luciferase reporter assay, western blotting, and isothermal titration calorimetry (itc).  <s3> results up-regulation of cnbp induced human fibrosarcoma cell death and suppressed fibrosarcoma cell motility and invasiveness. <s4> it was found that cnbp transcriptionally down-regulated the expression of heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein k (hnrnp k) through its conversion of a g-rich sequence into g-quadruplex in the promoter of hnrnp k. g-quadruplex stabilizing ligand tetra-(n-methyl-4-pyridyl) porphyrin (tmpyp4) could interact with and stabilize the g-quadruplex, resulting in downregulation of hnrnp k transcription.  <s5> conclusions cnbp overexpression caused increase of cell death and suppression of cell metastasis through its induction of g-quadruplex formation in the promoter of hnrnp k resulting in hnrnp k down-regulation.    <s6> general significance the present result provided a new solution for controlling hnrnp k expression, which should shed light on new anticancer drug design and development.

lp+ss: Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids supplementation reduces wheezing and asthma. <s0> cells cope with blockage of replication fork progression in a manner that allows dna synthesis to be completed and genomic instability minimized. <s1> models for resolution of blocked replication involve fork regression to form holliday junction structures. <s2> the human recq helicases wrn and blm (deficient in werner and bloom syndromes, respectively) are critical for maintaining genomic stability and thought to function in accurate resolution of replication blockage. <s3> consistent with this notion, wrn and blm localize to sites of blocked replication after certain dna-damaging treatments and exhibit enhanced activity on replication and recombination intermediates. <s4> here we examine the actions of wrn and blm on a special holliday junction substrate reflective of a regressed replication fork. <s5> our results demonstrate that, in reactions requiring atp hydrolysis, both wrn and blm convert this holliday junction substrate primarily to a four-stranded replication fork structure, suggesting they target the holliday junction to initiate branch migration. <s6> in agreement, the holliday junction binding protein ruva inhibits the wrn- and blm-mediated conversion reactions. <s7> importantly, this conversion product is suitable for replication with its leading daughter strand readily extended by dna polymerases. <s8> furthermore, binding to and conversion of this holliday junction are optimal at low mgcl(2) concentrations, suggesting that wrn and blm preferentially act on the square planar (open) conformation of holliday junctions. <s9> our findings suggest that, subsequent to fork regression events, wrn and/or blm could re-establish functional replication forks to help overcome fork blockage. <s10> such a function is highly consistent with phenotypes associated with wrn- and blm-deficient cells. 
lp+ss: Low expression of miR7a does not repress target genes or exert a biological function in ovaries. <s0> in february 2015 the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) published new guidance (ng3) on the management of diabetes in pregnancy. <s1> care teams need to be aware of this guidance and implement its recommendations. <s2> these include preconception care with target hba1c 48 mmol/mol. <s3> women at risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (gdm) should have a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (ogtt). <s4> diagnostic criteria for gdm have changed to fasting glucose of 5.6 mmol/l or above or 2 hour glucose of 7.8 mmol/l or above. <s5> glycaemic targets in all diabetic pregnancies have changed to fasting glucose below 5.3 mmol/l (4–5.2 mmol/l if on insulin) and 1 hour postprandial glucose below 7.8 mmol/l if these can be achieved safely. <s6> continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pump therapy should not be used routinely but can be used if glycaemic control is problematic. <s7> capillary ketone testing should be routine for women with type 1 diabetes when hyperglycaemic and for all women with diabetes including, gdm when acutely unwell. <s8> more flexibility is offered around recommended delivery timing: 37+0 weeks to 38+6 weeks for women with types 1 and 2 diabetes; prior to 40+6 in gdm (and earlier if complications arise). <s9> postnatal testing following gsm should be by fasting glucose (not ogtt) at 6–13 weeks post partum. <s10> testing later than this can use hba1c. <s11> introducing these changes will have resource implications, including a likely increase in the number of women diagnosed with gdm. 
lp+ss: Low expression of miR7a does not repress target genes or exert a biological function in testis. <s0> the eukaryotic genome consists of dna molecules far longer than the cells that contain them. <s1> they reach their greatest compaction during chromosome condensation in mitosis. <s2> this process is aided by condensin, a structural maintenance of chromosomes (smc) family member. <s3> the spatial organization of mitotic chromosomes and how condensin shapes chromatin architecture are not yet fully understood. <s4> here we use chromosome conformation capture (hi-c) to study mitotic chromosome condensation in the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe. <s5> this showed that the interphase landscape characterized by small chromatin domains is replaced by fewer but larger domains in mitosis. <s6> condensin achieves this by setting up longer-range, intrachromosomal dna interactions, which compact and individualize chromosomes. <s7> at the same time, local chromatin contacts are constrained by condensin, with profound implications for local chromatin function during mitosis. <s8> our results highlight condensin as a major determinant that changes the chromatin landscape as cells prepare their genomes for cell division. 
lp+ss: Low nucleosome occupancy correlates with high methylation levels across species. <s0> dnmt1 epigenetically propagates symmetrical cg methylation in many eukaryotes. <s1> their genomes are typically depleted of cg dinucleotides because of imperfect repair of deaminated methylcytosines. <s2> here, we extensively survey diverse species lacking dnmt1 and show that, surprisingly, symmetrical cg methylation is nonetheless frequently present and catalyzed by a different dna methyltransferase family, dnmt5. <s3> numerous dnmt5-containing organisms that diverged more than a billion years ago exhibit clustered methylation, specifically in nucleosome linkers. <s4> clustered methylation occurs at unprecedented densities and directly disfavors nucleosomes, contributing to nucleosome positioning between clusters. <s5> dense methylation is enabled by a regime of genomic sequence evolution that enriches cg dinucleotides and drives the highest cg frequencies known. <s6> species with linker methylation have small, transcriptionally active nuclei that approach the physical limits of chromatin compaction. <s7> these features constitute a previously unappreciated genome architecture, in which dense methylation influences nucleosome positions, likely facilitating nuclear processes under extreme spatial constraints.

lp+ss: Low nucleosome occupancy correlates with high methylation levels across species. <s0> polycomb repressive complex two (prc2) has been implicated in embryonic stem (es) cell pluripotency; however, the mechanistic roles of this complex are unclear. <s1> it was assumed that es cells contain prc2 with the same subunit composition as that identified in hela cells and drosophila embryos. <s2> here, we report that prc2 in mouse es cells contains at least three additional subunits: jarid2, mtf2, and a novel protein denoted esprc2p48. <s3> jarid2, mtf2, and esprc2p48 are highly expressed in mouse es cells compared to differentiated cells. <s4> importantly, knockdowns of jarid2, mtf2, or esprc2p48 alter the level of prc2-mediated h3k27 methylation and result in the expression of differentiation-associated genes in es cells. <s5> interestingly, expression of jarid2, mtf2, and esprc2p48 together, but not individually, enhances oct4/sox2/klf4-mediated reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mefs) into induced pluripotent stem cells, whereas knockdown or knockout of jarid2, mtf2, or esprc2p48 significantly inhibits reprogramming. <s6> jarid2, mtf2, and esprc2p48 modulate h3k27 methylation and facilitate repression of lineage-associated gene expression when transduced into mefs, and synergistically stimulate the histone methyltransferase activity of prc2 in vitro. <s7> therefore, these studies identify jarid2, mtf2, and esprc2p48 as important regulatory subunits of prc2 in es cells and reveal critical functions of these subunits in modulating prc2's activity and gene expression both in es cells and during somatic cell reprogramming. 
lp+ss: Ly49Q directs the organization of neutrophil polarization by regulating membrane raft functions. <s0> neutrophils rapidly undergo polarization and directional movement to infiltrate the sites of infection and inflammation. <s1> here, we show that an inhibitory mhc i receptor, ly49q, was crucial for the swift polarization of and tissue infiltration by neutrophils. <s2> during the steady state, ly49q inhibited neutrophil adhesion by preventing focal-complex formation, likely by inhibiting src and pi3 kinases. <s3> however, in the presence of inflammatory stimuli, ly49q mediated rapid neutrophil polarization and tissue infiltration in an itim-domain-dependent manner. <s4> these opposite functions appeared to be mediated by distinct use of effector phosphatase shp-1 and shp-2. <s5> ly49q-dependent polarization and migration were affected by ly49q regulation of membrane raft functions. <s6> we propose that ly49q is pivotal in switching neutrophils to their polarized morphology and rapid migration upon inflammation, through its spatiotemporal regulation of membrane rafts and raft-associated signaling molecules.

lp+ss: Ly6C hi monocytes have a higher inflammatory capacity than Ly6C lo monocytes. <s0> blood monocytes are well-characterized precursors for macrophages and dendritic cells. <s1> subsets of human monocytes with differential representation in various disease states are well known. <s2> in contrast, mouse monocyte subsets have been characterized minimally. <s3> in this study we identify three subpopulations of mouse monocytes that can be distinguished by differential expression of ly-6c, cd43, cd11c, mbr, and cd62l. <s4> the subsets share the characteristics of extensive phagocytosis, similar expression of m-csf receptor (cd115), and development into macrophages upon m-csf stimulation. <s5> by eliminating blood monocytes with dichloromethylene-bisphosphonate-loaded liposomes and monitoring their repopulation, we showed a developmental relationship between the subsets. <s6> monocytes were maximally depleted 18 h after liposome application and subsequently reappeared in the circulation. <s7> these cells were exclusively of the ly-6c(high) subset, resembling bone marrow monocytes. <s8> serial flow cytometric analyses of newly released ly-6c(high) monocytes showed that ly-6c expression on these cells was down-regulated while in circulation. <s9> under inflammatory conditions elicited either by acute infection with listeria monocytogenes or chronic infection with leishmania major, there was a significant increase in immature ly-6c(high) monocytes, resembling the inflammatory left shift of granulocytes. <s10> in addition, acute peritoneal inflammation recruited preferentially ly-6c(med-high) monocytes. <s11> taken together, these data identify distinct subpopulations of mouse blood monocytes that differ in maturation stage and capacity to become recruited to inflammatory sites.

lp+ss: Ly6C hi monocytes have a higher inflammatory capacity than Ly6C lo monocytes. <s0> mononuclear phagocytes, including monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, contribute to tissue integrity as well as to innate and adaptive immune defense. <s1> emerging evidence for labor division indicates that manipulation of these cells could bear therapeutic potential. <s2> however, specific ontogenies of individual populations and the overall functional organization of this cellular network are not well defined. <s3> here we report a fate-mapping study of the murine monocyte and macrophage compartment taking advantage of constitutive and conditional cx(3)cr1 promoter-driven cre recombinase expression. <s4> we have demonstrated that major tissue-resident macrophage populations, including liver kupffer cells and lung alveolar, splenic, and peritoneal macrophages, are established prior to birth and maintain themselves subsequently during adulthood independent of replenishment by blood monocytes. <s5> furthermore, we have established that short-lived ly6c(+) monocytes constitute obligatory steady-state precursors of blood-resident ly6c(-) cells and that the abundance of ly6c(+) blood monocytes dynamically controls the circulation lifespan of their progeny. 
lp+ss: Ly6C hi monocytes have a higher inflammatory capacity than Ly6C lo monocytes. <s0> cytochrome p450 (p450)-dependent metabolites of arachidonic acid, the epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (eets), are proposed to be endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors (edhf) that affect vascular tone; however, the effects of edhf on endothelial-derived nitric oxide biosynthesis remain unknown. <s1> we examined the regulation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (enos) by edhf and investigated the relevant signaling pathways involved. <s2> the p450 epoxygenases cyp102 f87v mutant, cyp2c11-cypor, and cyp2j2 were transfected into cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells, and the effects of endogenously formed or exogenously applied eets on enos expression and activity were assessed. <s3> transfection with the p450 epoxygenases led to increased enos protein expression, an effect that was attenuated by cotreatment with the p450 inhibitor 17-odya. <s4> northern analysis demonstrated that p450 transfection led to increased enos mrna levels consistent with an effect at the pretranslational level. <s5> p450 epoxygenase transfection resulted in increased enos activity as measured by the conversion of l-arginine to l-citrulline. <s6> addition of synthetic eets (50-200 nm) to the culture media also increased enos expression and activity. <s7> treatment with mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk), mapk kinase, and protein kinase c inhibitors apigenin, 2'-amino-3'-methoxyflavone (pd98059), and 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (h-7), respectively, significantly inhibited the effects of p450 transfection on enos expression. <s8> overexpression of p450 epoxygenases or addition of synthetic eets increased thr495 phosphorylation of enos, an effect that was inhibited by both apigenin and pd98059. <s9> overexpression of p450 epoxygenases in rats resulted in increased aortic enos expression, providing direct evidence that edhf can influence vascular enos levels in vivo. <s10> based on this data, we conclude that edhf up-regulates enos via activation of mapk and protein kinase c signaling pathways. 
lp+ss: M. stadtmanae does not induce ASC speck formation in BlaER1 monocytes. <s0> to explore the mechanism by which herpes simplex virus (hsv)-2 infection is related to hiv-1 acquisition, we conducted in situ analysis of the cellular infiltrate from sequential biopsies of hsv-2 lesions from patients on and off antiviral therapy. <s1> cd4(+) and cd8(+) t cells and a mixed population of plasmacytoid and myeloid dendritic cells (dcs), including cells expressing the c-type lectin receptor dc-sign, persisted at sites of hsv-2 reactivation for months after healing, even with daily antiviral therapy. <s2> the cd4(+) t cells that persisted reacted to hsv-2 antigen, were enriched for expression of the chemokine receptor ccr5, and were contiguous to dcs expressing the interleukin-3 receptor cd123 or dc-sign. <s3> ex vivo infection with a ccr5-tropic strain of hiv-1 revealed greater concentrations of integrated hiv-1 dna in cells derived from healed genital lesion biopsies than in cells from control skin biopsies. <s4> the persistence and enrichment of hiv receptor-positive inflammatory cells in the genitalia help explain the inability of anti-hsv-2 therapy to reduce hiv acquisition. 
lp+ss: M. stadtmanae does not induce ASC speck formation in BlaER1 monocytes. <s0> interleukin-1β (il-1β) is a cytokine whose bioactivity is controlled by activation of the inflammasome. <s1> however, in response to lipopolysaccharide, human monocytes secrete il-1β independently of classical inflammasome stimuli. <s2> here, we report that this constituted a species-specific response that is not observed in the murine system. <s3> indeed, in human monocytes, lipopolysaccharide triggered an "alternative inflammasome" that relied on nlrp3-asc-caspase-1 signaling, yet was devoid of any classical inflammasome characteristics including pyroptosome formation, pyroptosis induction, and k(+) efflux dependency. <s4> genetic dissection of the underlying signaling pathway in a monocyte transdifferentiation system revealed that alternative inflammasome activation was propagated by tlr4-trif-ripk1-fadd-casp8 signaling upstream of nlrp3. <s5> importantly, involvement of this signaling cascade was limited to alternative inflammasome activation and did not extend to classical nlrp3 activation. <s6> because alternative inflammasome activation embraces both sensitivity and promiscuity of tlr4, we propose a pivotal role for this signaling cascade in tlr4-driven, il-1β-mediated immune responses and immunopathology in humans.

lp+ss: MICAL redox enzymes regulate actin dynamics in many cell types. <s0> the overall size and structure of a synaptic terminal is an important determinant of its function. <s1> in a large-scale mutagenesis screen, designed to identify drosophila mutants with abnormally structured neuromuscular junctions (nmjs), we discovered mutations in drosophila mical, a conserved gene encoding a multi-domain protein with a n-terminal monooxygenase domain. <s2> in mical mutants, synaptic boutons do not sprout normally over the muscle surface and tend to form clusters along synaptic branches and at nerve entry sites. <s3> consistent with high expression of mical in somatic muscles, immunohistochemical stainings reveal that the subcellular localization and architecture of contractile muscle filaments are dramatically disturbed in mical mutants. <s4> instead of being integrated into a regular sarcomeric pattern, actin and myosin filaments are disorganized and accumulate beneath the plasmamembrane. <s5> whereas contractile elements are strongly deranged, the proposed organizer of sarcomeric structure, d-titin, is much less affected. <s6> transgenic expression of interfering rna molecules demonstrates that mical is required in muscles for the higher order arrangement of myofilaments. <s7> ultrastructural analysis confirms that myosin-rich thick filaments enter submembranous regions and interfere with synaptic development, indicating that the disorganized myofilaments may cause the synaptic growth phenotype. <s8> as a model, we suggest that the filamentous network around synaptic boutons restrains the spreading of synaptic branches.

lp+ss: MICAL redox enzymes regulate actin dynamics. <s0> semaphorin3a (sema3a) is a repulsive guidance molecule for axons, which acts by inducing growth cone collapse through phosphorylation of crmp2 (collapsin response mediator protein 2). <s1> here, we show a role for crmp2 oxidation and thioredoxin (trx) in the regulation of crmp2 phosphorylation and growth cone collapse. <s2> sema3a stimulation generated hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) through mical (molecule interacting with casl) and oxidized crmp2, enabling it to form a disulfide-linked homodimer through cysteine-504. <s3> oxidized crmp2 then formed a transient disulfide-linked complex with trx, which stimulated crmp2 phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase-3, leading to growth cone collapse. <s4> we also reconstituted oxidation-dependent phosphorylation of crmp2 in vitro, using a limited set of purified proteins. <s5> our results not only clarify the importance of h2o2 and crmp2 oxidation in sema3a-induced growth cone collapse but also indicate an unappreciated role for trx in linking crmp2 oxidation to phosphorylation.

lp+ss: MICAL redox enzymes regulate actin dynamics. <s0> objective the purpose of this study was to characterize the relationship between adipose tissue phenotype and depot-specific microvascular function in fat.  <s1> methods and results in 30 obese subjects (age 42±11 years, body mass index 46±11 kg/m(2)) undergoing bariatric surgery, we intraoperatively collected visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue and characterized depot-specific adipose phenotypes. <s2> we assessed vasomotor function of the adipose microvasculature using videomicroscopy of small arterioles (75-250 μm) isolated from different fat compartments. <s3> endothelium-dependent, acetylcholine-mediated vasodilation was severely impaired in visceral arterioles, compared to the subcutaneous depot (p<0.001 by anova). <s4> nonendothelium dependent responses to papaverine and nitroprusside were similar. <s5> endothelial nitric oxide synthase inhibition with n(ω)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester reduced subcutaneous vasodilation but had no effect on severely blunted visceral arteriolar responses. <s6> visceral fat exhibited greater expression of proinflammatory, oxidative stress-related, hypoxia-induced, and proangiogenic genes; increased activated macrophage populations; and had a higher capacity for cytokine production ex vivo.  <s7> conclusions our findings provide clinical evidence that the visceral microenvironment may be intrinsically toxic to arterial health providing a potential mechanism by which visceral adiposity burden is linked to atherosclerotic vascular disease. <s8> our findings also support the evolving concept that both adipose tissue quality and quantity may play significant roles in shaping cardiovascular phenotypes in human obesity. 
lp+ss: MT binding domain drives amyloid structure formation. <s0> several components of the wnt signaling cascade have been shown to function either as tumor suppressor proteins or as oncogenes in multiple human cancers, underscoring the relevance of this pathway in oncogenesis and the need for further investigation of wnt signaling components as potential targets for cancer therapy. <s1> here, using expression profiling analysis as well as in vitro and in vivo functional studies, we show that the wnt pathway component bcl9 is a novel oncogene that is aberrantly expressed in human multiple myeloma as well as colon carcinoma. <s2> we show that bcl9 enhances beta-catenin-mediated transcriptional activity regardless of the mutational status of the wnt signaling components and increases cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and the metastatic potential of tumor cells by promoting loss of epithelial and gain of mesenchymal-like phenotype. <s3> most importantly, bcl9 knockdown significantly increased the survival of xenograft mouse models of cancer by reducing tumor load, metastasis, and host angiogenesis through down-regulation of c-myc, cyclin d1, cd44, and vascular endothelial growth factor expression by tumor cells. <s4> together, these findings suggest that deregulation of bcl9 is an important contributing factor to tumor progression. <s5> the pleiotropic roles of bcl9 reported in this study underscore its value as a drug target for therapeutic intervention in several malignancies associated with aberrant wnt signaling.

lp+ss: Major antigen-induced signals from the T cell receptor and secondary signals from costimulatory receptors are required for T cell activation. <s0> among the pleiotropic effects of aminoglycosides, their irreversible uptake and their blockade of initiating ribosomes have appeared to explain their bactericidal action, while the contributions of translational misreading and membrane damage and the mechanism of that damage have remained uncertain. <s1> we now present evidence that incorporation of misread proteins into the membrane can account for the membrane damage. <s2> the bactericidal action thus appears to result from the following sequence, in which each step is essential: slight initial entry of the antibiotic; interaction with chain-elongating ribosomes, resulting in misreading; incorporation of misread protein into the membrane, creating abnormal channels; increased (and irreversible) entry through these channels, and hence increased misreading and formation of channels; and, finally, blockade of initiating ribosomes. <s3> this mechanism can account for several previously unexplained observations: that streptomycin uptake requires protein synthesis during, but not after, the lag before the membrane damage; that streptomycin-resistant cells, which fail to take up streptomycin, can do so after treatment by another aminoglycoside; and that puromycin at moderate concentrations accelerates streptomycin uptake, while high concentrations (which release shorter chains) prevent it. <s4> in addition, puromycin, prematurely releasing polypeptides of normal sequence, also evidently creates channels, since it is reported to promote streptomycin uptake even in streptomycin-resistant cells. <s5> these findings imply that normal membrane proteins must be selected not only for a hydrophobic anchoring surface, but also for a tight fit in the membrane.

lp+ss: MeCP2 influences the synaptic maturation of neurons. <s0> as the nervous system develops, there is an inherent variability in the connections formed between differentiating neurons. <s1> despite this variability, neural circuits form that are functional and remarkably robust. <s2> one way in which neurons deal with variability in their inputs is through compensatory, homeostatic changes in their electrical properties. <s3> here, we show that neurons also make compensatory adjustments to their structure. <s4> we analysed the development of dendrites on an identified central neuron (acc) in the late drosophila embryo at the stage when it receives its first connections and first becomes electrically active. <s5> at the same time, we charted the distribution of presynaptic sites on the developing postsynaptic arbor. <s6> genetic manipulations of the presynaptic partners demonstrate that the postsynaptic dendritic arbor adjusts its growth to compensate for changes in the activity and density of synaptic sites. <s7> blocking the synthesis or evoked release of presynaptic neurotransmitter results in greater dendritic extension. <s8> conversely, an increase in the density of presynaptic release sites induces a reduction in the extent of the dendritic arbor. <s9> these growth adjustments occur locally in the arbor and are the result of the promotion or inhibition of growth of neurites in the proximity of presynaptic sites. <s10> we provide evidence that suggest a role for the postsynaptic activity state of protein kinase a in mediating this structural adjustment, which modifies dendritic growth in response to synaptic activity. <s11> these findings suggest that the dendritic arbor, at least during early stages of connectivity, behaves as a homeostatic device that adjusts its size and geometry to the level and the distribution of input received. <s12> the growing arbor thus counterbalances naturally occurring variations in synaptic density and activity so as to ensure that an appropriate level of input is achieved.

lp+ss: Medications to treat obesity do not have side effects. <s0> bacteriophage t4 dda helicase has recently been shown to be active as a monomer for unwinding of short duplex oligonucleotides and for displacing streptavidin from 3′-biotinylated oligonucleotides. <s1> however, its activity for streptavidin displacement and dna unwinding has been shown to increase as the number of dda molecules bound to the substrate molecule increases. <s2> a substrate was designed to address the ability of dda to displace dna binding proteins. <s3> a dna binding site for the escherichia coli trp repressor was introduced into an oligonucleotide substrate for dda helicase containing single-stranded overhang. <s4> here we show that a dda monomer is insufficient to displace the e.coli trp repressor from dsdna under single turnover conditions, although the substrate is unwound and the repressor displaced when the single-stranded overhang is long enough to accommodate two dda molecules. <s5> the quantity of product formed increases when the substrate is able to accommodate more than two dda molecules. <s6> these results indicate that multiple dda molecules act to displace dna binding proteins in a manner that correlates with the dna unwinding activity and streptavidin displacement activity. <s7> we suggest a cooperative inchworm model to describe the activities of dda helicase.

lp+ss: Medications to treat obesity have unwanted side effects. <s0> telomeres are the physical ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. <s1> genetic studies have established that the baker's yeast pif1p dna helicase is a negative regulator of telomerase, the specialized reverse transcriptase that maintains telomeric dna, but the biochemical basis for this inhibition was unknown. <s2> here we show that in vitro, pif1p reduces the processivity of telomerase and releases telomerase from telomeric oligonucleotides. <s3> the released telomerase is enzymatically active because it is able to lengthen a challenger oligonucleotide. <s4> in vivo, overexpression of pif1p reduces telomerase association with telomeres, whereas depleting cells of pif1p increases the levels of telomere-bound est1p, a telomerase subunit that is present on the telomere when telomerase is active. <s5> we propose that pif1p helicase activity limits telomerase action both in vivo and in vitro by displacing active telomerase from dna ends.

lp+ss: Metastatic colorectal cancer treated with a single agent fluoropyrimidines resulted in similar efficacy and better quality of life when compared with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in elderly patients. <s0> purpose the goal of this study was to evaluate prospectively the engraftment rate, factors influencing engraftment, and predictability of clinical outcome of low-passage xenografts from patients with resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (pda) and to establish a bank of pda xenografts.    <s1> experimental design patients with resectable pda scheduled for resection at the johns hopkins hospital were eligible. <s2> representative pieces of tumor were implanted in nude mice. <s3> the status of the smad4 gene and content of tumor-generating cells were determined by immunohistochemistry. <s4> gene expression was carried out by using a u133 plus 2.0 array. <s5> patients were followed for progression and survival.  <s6> results a total of 94 patients with pda were resected, 69 tumors implanted in nude mice, and 42 (61%) engrafted. <s7> engrafted carcinomas were more often smad4 mutant, and had a metastatic gene expression signature and worse prognosis. <s8> tumors from patients resistant to gemcitabine were enriched in stroma-related gene pathways. <s9> tumors sensitive to gemcitabine were enriched in cell cycle and pyrimidine gene pathways. <s10> the time to progression for patients who received treatment with gemcitabine for metastatic disease (n = 7) was double in patients with xenografts sensitive to gemcitabine.  <s11> conclusion a successful xenograft was generated in 61% of patients attempted, generating a pool of 42 pda xenografts with significant biological information and annotated clinical data. <s12> patients with pda and smad4 inactivation have a better engraftment rate. <s13> engraftment is a poor prognosis factor, and engrafted tumors have a metastatic gene expression signature. <s14> tumors from gemcitabine-resistant patients were enriched in stromal pathways. 
lp+ss: Mice are incapable of producing neutralizing antibodies in reponse to the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) produced in mosquitos. <s0> traditionally, vaccine development involves tradeoffs between immunogenicity and safety. <s1> live-attenuated vaccines typically offer rapid and durable immunity but have reduced safety when compared to inactivated vaccines. <s2> in contrast, the inability of inactivated vaccines to replicate enhances safety at the expense of immunogenicity, often necessitating multiple doses and boosters. <s3> to overcome these tradeoffs, we developed the insect-specific alphavirus, eilat virus (eilv), as a vaccine platform. <s4> to address the chikungunya fever (chikf) pandemic, we used an eilv cdna clone to design a chimeric virus containing the chikungunya virus (chikv) structural proteins. <s5> the recombinant eilv/chikv was structurally identical at 10 å to wild-type chikv, as determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, and it mimicked the early stages of chikv replication in vertebrate cells from attachment and entry to viral rna delivery. <s6> yet the recombinant virus remained completely defective for productive replication, providing a high degree of safety. <s7> a single dose of eilv/chikv produced in mosquito cells elicited rapid (within 4 d) and long-lasting (>290 d) neutralizing antibodies that provided complete protection in two different mouse models. <s8> in nonhuman primates, eilv/chikv elicited rapid and robust immunity that protected against viremia and telemetrically monitored fever. <s9> our eilv platform represents the first structurally native application of an insect-specific virus in preclinical vaccine development and highlights the potential application of such viruses in vaccinology.

lp+ss: Mice defective for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase I (polI) fail to reveal increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR). <s0> dna polymerases mu (pol mu), lambda (pol lambda), and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (tdt) are enzymes of the pol x family that share homology in sequence and functional domain organization. <s1> we showed previously that pol mu participates in light chain but surprisingly not heavy chain gene rearrangement. <s2> we show here that immunoglobulin heavy chain junctions from pol lambda-deficient animals have shorter length with normal n-additions, thus indicating that pol lambda is recruited during heavy chain rearrangement at a step that precedes the action of tdt. in contrast to previous in vitro studies, analysis of animals with combined inactivation of these enzymes revealed no overlapping or compensatory activities for v(d)j recombination between pol mu, pol lambda, and tdt. this complex usage of polymerases with distinct catalytic specificities may correspond to the specific function that the third hypervariable region assumes for each immunoglobulin chain, with pol lambda maintaining a large heavy chain junctional heterogeneity and pol mu ensuring a restricted light chain junctional variability. 
lp+ss: Mice defective for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase m (polm) fail to reveal increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR). <s0> polycomb group (pcg) proteins are required for the epigenetic maintenance of developmental genes in a silent state. <s1> proteins in the polycomb-repressive complex 1 (prc1) class of the pcg are conserved from flies to humans and inhibit transcription. <s2> one hypothesis for prc1 mechanism is that it compacts chromatin, based in part on electron microscopy experiments demonstrating that drosophila prc1 compacts nucleosomal arrays. <s3> we show that this function is conserved between drosophila and mouse prc1 complexes and requires a region with an overrepresentation of basic amino acids. <s4> while the active region is found in the posterior sex combs (psc) subunit in drosophila, it is unexpectedly found in a different prc1 subunit, a polycomb homolog called m33, in mice. <s5> we provide experimental support for the general importance of a charged region by predicting the compacting capability of pcg proteins from species other than drosophila and mice and by testing several of these proteins using solution assays and microscopy. <s6> we infer that the ability of pcg proteins to compact chromatin in vitro can be predicted by the presence of domains of high positive charge and that prc1 components from a variety of species conserve this highly charged region. <s7> this supports the hypothesis that compaction is a key aspect of pcg function. 
lp+ss: Mice defective for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase m (polm) reveal increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR). <s0> genome-wide association studies (gwas) have identified common polymorphisms in or near gc, cyp2r1, cyp24a1, and nadsyn1/dhcr7 genes to be associated with circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin d [25(oh)d] in european populations. <s1> to replicate these gwas findings, we examined six selected polymorphisms from these regions and their relation with circulating 25(oh)d levels in 1,605 hispanic women (629 u.s. hispanics and 976 mexicans) and 354 non-hispanic white (nhw) women. <s2> we also assessed the potential interactions between these variants and known non-genetic predictors of 25(oh)d levels, including body mass index (bmi), sunlight exposure and vitamin d intake from diet and supplements. <s3> the minor alleles of the two gc polymorphisms (rs7041 and rs2282679) were significantly associated with lower 25(oh)d levels in both hispanic and nhw women. <s4> the cyp2r1 polymorphism, rs2060793, also was significantly associated with 25(oh)d levels in both groups. <s5> we found no significant associations for the polymorphisms in the cyp24a1. <s6> in hispanic controls, 25(oh)d levels were significantly associated with the rs12785878t and rs1790349g haplotype in the nadsyn1/dhcr7 region. <s7> significant interactions between gc rs2282679 and bmi and between rs12785878 and time spent in outdoor activities were observed. <s8> these results provide further support for the contribution of common genetic variants to individual variability in circulating 25(oh)d levels. <s9> the observed interactions between snps and non-genetic factors warrant confirmation. 
lp+ss: Mice defective for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase m (polm) reveal increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR). <s0> electroretinography (erg) is an established diagnostic technique in clinical ophthalmology and provides objective information about retinal function. <s1> this technique is also applied in basic research, where animal models of hereditary retinopathies have significantly contributed to our understanding of the composition of erg responses in general and how retinal degenerative pathologies alter retinal function specifically. <s2> indeed, electrophysiologic assessment of transgenic mice, which are genetically engineered to mimic human mutations that lead to retinal diseases, can be well compared with clinical data. <s3> furthermore, limitations on examinations (e.g. length of measurement, range of light intensity) are much less of a concern when assessing mice compared to human patients. <s4> in order to measure and analyze retinal responses properly, several important aspects have to be considered. <s5> this paper focuses on these aspects, and shows exemplary erg data which were obtained from normal wild-type mice and from transgenic mice with specific functional properties, namely rho-/- (rod opsin knockout, cone function only), and cnga3-/- (cone cng channel deficient, rod function only) to illustrate rod and cone system contributions to erg responses.

lp+ss: Microglia are an innate immune cell type of the central nervous system. <s0> background: a proposed revision of sepsis definitions has abandoned the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (sirs), defined organ dysfunction as an increase in total sequential organ function assessment (sofa) score of ≥ 2, and conceived "qsofa" (quick sofa) as a bedside indicator of organ dysfunction. <s1> we aimed to (1) determine the prognostic impact of sirs, (2) compare the diagnostic accuracy of sirs and qsofa for organ dysfunction, and (3) compare standard (sepsis‐2) and revised (sepsis‐3) definitions for organ dysfunction in ed patients with infection.  <s2> methods: consecutive ed patients admitted with presumed infection were prospectively enrolled over 3 years. <s3> sufficient observational data were collected to calculate sirs, qsofa, sofa, comorbidity, and mortality.  <s4> results: we enrolled 8,871 patients, with sirs present in 4,176 (47.1%). <s5> sirs was associated with increased risk of organ dysfunction (relative risk [rr] 3.5) and mortality in patients without organ dysfunction (or 3.2). <s6> sirs and qsofa showed similar discrimination for organ dysfunction (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.72 vs 0.73). <s7> qsofa was specific but poorly sensitive for organ dysfunction (96.1% and 29.7%, respectively). <s8> mortality for patients with organ dysfunction was similar for sepsis‐2 and sepsis‐3 (12.5% and 11.4%, respectively), although 29% of patients with sepsis‐3 organ dysfunction did not meet sepsis‐2 criteria. <s9> increasing numbers of sepsis‐2 organ system dysfunctions were associated with greater mortality.  <s10> conclusions: sirs was associated with organ dysfunction and mortality, and abandoning the concept appears premature. <s11> a qsofa score ≥ 2 showed high specificity, but poor sensitivity may limit utility as a bedside screening method. <s12> although mortality for organ dysfunction was comparable between sepsis‐2 and sepsis‐3, more prognostic and clinical information is conveyed using sepsis‐2 regarding number and type of organ dysfunctions. <s13> the sofa score may require recalibration.

lp+ss: Misunderstandings between doctors and patients can lead to non-adherence. <s0> secretion systems require high-fidelity mechanisms to discriminate substrates among the vast cytoplasmic pool of proteins. <s1> factors mediating substrate recognition by the type vi secretion system (t6ss) of gram-negative bacteria, a widespread pathway that translocates effector proteins into target bacterial cells, have not been defined. <s2> we report that haemolysin coregulated protein (hcp), a ring-shaped hexamer secreted by all characterized t6sss, binds specifically to cognate effector molecules. <s3> electron microscopy analysis of an hcp-effector complex from pseudomonas aeruginosa revealed the effector bound to the inner surface of hcp. <s4> further studies demonstrated that interaction with the hcp pore is a general requirement for secretion of diverse effectors encompassing several enzymatic classes. <s5> though previous models depict hcp as a static conduit, our data indicate it is a chaperone and receptor of substrates. <s6> these unique functions of a secreted protein highlight fundamental differences between the export mechanism of t6 and other characterized secretory pathways.

lp+ss: Moderate consumption of candy and chocolate reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). <s0> background production of the gtp-bound form of the ran gtpase (rangtp) around chromosomes induces spindle assembly by activating nuclear localization signal (nls)-containing proteins. <s1> several nls proteins have been identified as spindle assembly factors, but the complexity of the process led us to search for additional proteins with distinct roles in spindle assembly.  <s2> results we identify a chromatin-remodeling atpase, chd4, as a rangtp-dependent microtubule (mt)-associated protein (map). <s3> mt binding occurs via the region containing an nls and chromatin-binding domains. <s4> in xenopus egg extracts and cultured cells, chd4 largely dissociates from mitotic chromosomes and partially localizes to the spindle. <s5> immunodepletion of chd4 from egg extracts significantly reduces the quantity of mts produced around chromatin and prevents spindle assembly. <s6> chd4 rnai in both hela and drosophila s2 cells induces defects in spindle assembly and chromosome alignment in early mitosis, leading to chromosome missegregation. <s7> further analysis in egg extracts and in hela cells reveals that chd4 is a rangtp-dependent mt stabilizer. <s8> moreover, the chd4-containing nurd complex promotes organization of mts into bipolar spindles in egg extracts. <s9> importantly, this function of chd4 is independent of chromatin remodeling.  <s10> conclusions our results uncover a new role for chd4 as a map required for mt stabilization and involved in generating spindle bipolarity.

lp+ss: Monoclonal antibody targeting of N-cadherin encourages metastasis. <s0> proteins of the argonaute family are small rna carriers that guide regulatory complexes to their targets. <s1> the family comprises two major subclades. <s2> members of the ago subclade, which are present in most eukaryotic phyla, bind different classes of small rnas and regulate gene expression at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. <s3> piwi subclade members appear to have been lost in plants and fungi and were mostly studied in metazoa, where they bind pirnas and have essential roles in sexual reproduction. <s4> their presence in ciliates, unicellular organisms harbouring both germline micronuclei and somatic macronuclei, offers an interesting perspective on the evolution of their functions. <s5> here, we report phylogenetic and functional analyses of the 15 piwi genes from paramecium tetraurelia. <s6> we show that four constitutively expressed proteins are involved in sirna pathways that mediate gene silencing throughout the life cycle. <s7> two other proteins, specifically expressed during meiosis, are required for accumulation of scnrnas during sexual reproduction and for programmed genome rearrangements during development of the somatic macronucleus. <s8> our results indicate that paramecium piwi proteins have evolved to perform both vegetative and sexual functions through mechanisms ranging from post-transcriptional mrna cleavage to epigenetic regulation of genome rearrangements.

lp+ss: Most termination events in Okazaki fragments are dictated by initiation patterns. <s0> many fundamental aspects of dna replication, such as the exact locations where dna synthesis is initiated and terminated, how frequently origins are used, and how fork progression is influenced by transcription, are poorly understood. <s1> via the deep sequencing of okazaki fragments, we comprehensively document replication fork directionality throughout the s. cerevisiae genome, which permits the systematic analysis of initiation, origin efficiency, fork progression, and termination. <s2> we show that leading-strand initiation preferentially occurs within a nucleosome-free region at replication origins. <s3> using a strain in which late origins can be induced to fire early, we show that replication termination is a largely passive phenomenon that does not rely on cis-acting sequences or replication fork pausing. <s4> the replication profile is predominantly determined by the kinetics of origin firing, allowing us to reconstruct chromosome-wide timing profiles from an asynchronous culture.

lp+ss: Mouse models can be generated using "artificial spermatids." <s0> haploid cells are amenable for genetic analysis. <s1> recent success in the derivation of mouse haploid embryonic stem cells (haescs) via parthenogenesis has enabled genetic screening in mammalian cells. <s2> however, successful generation of live animals from these haescs, which is needed to extend the genetic analysis to the organism level, has not been achieved. <s3> here, we report the derivation of haescs from androgenetic blastocysts. <s4> these cells, designated as ag-haescs, partially maintain paternal imprints, express classical esc pluripotency markers, and contribute to various tissues, including the germline, upon injection into diploid blastocysts. <s5> strikingly, live mice can be obtained upon injection of ag-haescs into mii oocytes, and these mice bear haesc-carried genetic traits and develop into fertile adults. <s6> furthermore, gene targeting via homologous recombination is feasible in the ag-haescs. <s7> our results demonstrate that ag-haescs can be used as a genetically tractable fertilization agent for the production of live animals via injection into oocytes.

lp+ss: Mutant mice lacking SVCT2 have severely reduced ascorbic acid levels in both brain and adrenals. <s0> the only proven requirement for ascorbic acid (vitamin c) is in preventing scurvy, presumably because it is a cofactor for hydroxylases required for post-translational modifications that stabilize collagen. <s1> we have created mice deficient in the mouse ortholog (solute carrier family 23 member 1 or slc23a1) of a rat ascorbic-acid transporter, svct2 (ref. <s2> 4). <s3> cultured embryonic fibroblasts from homozygous slc23a1−/− mice had less than 5% of normal ascorbic-acid uptake. <s4> ascorbic-acid levels were undetectable or markedly reduced in the blood and tissues of slc23a1−/− mice. <s5> prenatal supplementation of pregnant females did not elevate blood ascorbic acid in slc23a1−/− fetuses, suggesting slc23a1 is important in placental ascorbic-acid transport. <s6> slc23a1−/− mice died within a few minutes of birth with respiratory failure and intraparenchymal brain hemorrhage. <s7> lungs showed no postnatal expansion but had normal surfactant protein b levels. <s8> brain hemorrhage was unlikely to be simply a form of scurvy since slc23a1−/− mice showed no hemorrhage in any other tissues and their skin had normal skin 4-hydroxyproline levels despite low ascorbic-acid content. <s9> we conclude that slc23a1 is required for transport of ascorbic acid into many tissues and across the placenta. <s10> deficiency of the transporter is lethal in newborn mice, thereby revealing a previously unrecognized requirement for ascorbic acid in the perinatal period.

lp+ss: Mutant mice lacking SVCT2 have severely reduced ascorbic acid levels in both brain and adrenals. <s0> germline mutations in the ret tyrosine kinase gene are responsible for the development of multiple endocrine neoplasia 2a and 2b (men2a and men2b). <s1> however, knowledge of the fundamental principles that determine the mutant ret-mediated signaling remains elusive. <s2> here, we report increased expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-2 (mkp-2) in carcinomas developed in transgenic mice carrying ret with the men2a mutation (ret-men2a). <s3> the expression of mkp-2 was not only induced by ret-men2a or ret-men2b mutant proteins but also by the activation of endogenous ret by its ligand, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (gdnf). <s4> mkp-2 expression was also evident in the mkk-f cell line, which was established from a mammary tumor developed in a ret-men2a transgenic mouse. <s5> inhibition of mkp-2 attenuated the in vitro and in vivo proliferation of mkk-f cells, which was mediated by the suppression of cyclin b1 expression. <s6> furthermore, we found that mkp-2 is highly expressed in medullary thyroid carcinomas derived from men2a patients. <s7> these findings suggest that the increased expression of mkp-2 may play a crucial role in oncogenic signaling downstream of mutant ret, leading to deregulation of cell cycle. 
lp+ss: Mutant mice lacking SVCT2 have severely reduced ascorbic acid levels in both brain and adrenals. <s0> for more than 60 years, the chemical induction of tumors in mouse skin has been used to study mechanisms of epithelial carcinogenesis and evaluate modifying factors. <s1> in the traditional two-stage skin carcinogenesis model, the initiation phase is accomplished by the application of a sub-carcinogenic dose of a carcinogen. <s2> subsequently, tumor development is elicited by repeated treatment with a tumor-promoting agent. <s3> the initiation protocol can be completed within 1–3 h depending on the number of mice used; whereas the promotion phase requires twice weekly treatments (1–2 h) and once weekly tumor palpation (1–2 h) for the duration of the study. <s4> using the protocol described here, a highly reproducible papilloma burden is expected within 10–20 weeks with progression of a portion of the tumors to squamous cell carcinomas within 20–50 weeks. <s5> in contrast to complete skin carcinogenesis, the two-stage model allows for greater yield of premalignant lesions, as well as separation of the initiation and promotion phases. 
lp+ss: Mutations in G-Beta protein GNB1 are present in many cancers, resulting in loss of interaction with G-alpha subunits and concomitant activation of AKT pathway. <s0> macromolecular x-ray crystallography is routinely applied to understand biological processes at a molecular level. <s1> however, significant time and effort are still required to solve and complete many of these structures because of the need for manual interpretation of complex numerical data using many software packages and the repeated use of interactive three-dimensional graphics. <s2> phenix has been developed to provide a comprehensive system for macromolecular crystallographic structure solution with an emphasis on the automation of all procedures. <s3> this has relied on the development of algorithms that minimize or eliminate subjective input, the development of algorithms that automate procedures that are traditionally performed by hand and, finally, the development of a framework that allows a tight integration between the algorithms. 
lp+ss: Mutations in RIM1 decrease levels of IME1 RNA. <s0> in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, genetic studies suggest that the rim1 gene encodes a positive regulator of meiosis. <s1> rim1 mutations cause reduced expression of ime1, which is required for expression of many meiotic genes, and thus lead to a partial defect in meiosis and spore formation. <s2> we report the sequence of rim1 and functional analysis of its coding region. <s3> the rim1 gene product (rim1) contains three regions similar to c2h2 zinc fingers. <s4> serine substitutions for cysteine in each of the putative zinc fingers abolish rim1 function. <s5> the carboxyl-terminus of rim1 is enriched in acidic amino acids and is required for full rim1 activity. <s6> rim1 also contains two putative camp-dependent protein kinase (capk) phosphorylation sites. <s7> at one site, substitution of alanine for serine does not affect rim1 activity; at the other site, this substitution impairs activity. <s8> this analysis of rim1 suggests that the protein may function as a transcriptional activator. <s9> we have used the cloned rim1 gene to create a complete rim1 deletion. <s10> this null allele, like previously isolated rim1 mutations, causes a partial meiotic defect. <s11> in addition to rim1, maximum ime1 expression requires the mck1 and ime4 gene products. <s12> defects associated with rim1, mck1, and ime4 mutations in expression of a meiotic reporter gene (ime2-lacz) and in sporulation are additive. <s13> these findings suggest that rim1 acts independently of mck1 and ime4 to stimulate ime1 expression.

lp+ss: Myelin sheaths are lipid-rich cellular structures. <s0> anorectic drugs have been used for more than 30 years as an aid in weight reduction for obese persons. <s1> the use of aminorex, an amphetamine analog that increases norepinephrine levels in the central nervous system, led to an epidemic of primary pulmonary hypertension (pph) in europe in the late 1960s and early 1970s. <s2> the use of fenfluramine and later dexfenfluramine [drugs that inhibit 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) release and reuptake and increases 5-ht and thus 5-ht secretion in the brain] was associated with a second epidemic of pph. <s3> all of these drugs have been voluntarily withdrawn from the market. <s4> the pathogenesis of pph in patients treated with these agents is uncertain, but recent evidence suggests that potassium channel abnormalities and vasoactive and proliferative properties of 5-ht may play a role. <s5> there is increasing experimental evidence suggesting that aminorex, fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine inhibit 4-aminopyridine-sensitive currents in potassium channels resulting in vasoconstriction in pulmonary resistance vessels and perhaps smooth muscle cell proliferation. <s6> 5-ht causes pulmonary artery vasoconstriction and smooth muscle cell proliferation. <s7> its levels are known to be high in those with fenfluramine-induced pph. <s8> however, a firm cause-and-effect relationship has not yet been established. <s9> one potentially beneficial effect of the epidemics of anorectic-related pph is that it may have provided important insights into the causes of pph unrelated to anorectic agents.

lp+ss: N348I mutations cause resistance to nevirapine. <s0> the role of specific phospholipids (pls) in lipid transport has been difficult to assess due to an inability to selectively manipulate membrane composition in vivo. <s1> here we show that the phospholipid remodeling enzyme lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (lpcat3) is a critical determinant of triglyceride (tg) secretion due to its unique ability to catalyze the incorporation of arachidonate into membranes. <s2> mice lacking lpcat3 in the intestine fail to thrive during weaning and exhibit enterocyte lipid accumulation and reduced plasma tgs. <s3> mice lacking lpcat3 in the liver show reduced plasma tgs, hepatosteatosis, and secrete lipid-poor very low-density lipoprotein (vldl) lacking arachidonoyl pls. <s4> mechanistic studies indicate that lpcat3 activity impacts membrane lipid mobility in living cells, suggesting a biophysical basis for the requirement of arachidonoyl pls in lipidating lipoprotein particles. <s5> these data identify lpcat3 as a key factor in lipoprotein production and illustrate how manipulation of membrane composition can be used as a regulatory mechanism to control metabolic pathways. 
lp+ss: N348I mutations cause resistance to nevirapine. <s0> two human golli (for gene expressed in the oligodendrocyte lineage)-mbp (for myelin basic protein) cdnas have been isolated from a human oligodendroglioma cell line. <s1> analysis of these cdnas has enabled us to determine the entire structure of the human golli-mbp gene. <s2> the golli-mbp gene, which encompasses the mbp transcription unit, is approximately 179 kb in length and consists of 10 exons, seven of which constitute the mbp gene. <s3> the human golli-mbp gene contains two transcription start sites, each of which gives rise to a family of alternatively spliced transcripts. <s4> at least two golli-mbp transcripts, containing the first three exons of the gene and one or more mbp exons, are produced from the first transcription start site. <s5> the second family of transcripts contains only mbp exons and produces the well-known mbps. <s6> in humans, rna blot analysis revealed that golli-mbp transcripts were expressed in fetal thymus, spleen, and human b-cell and macrophage cell lines, as well as in fetal spinal cord. <s7> these findings clearly link the expression of exons encoding the autoimmunogen/encephalitogen mbp in the central nervous system to cells and tissues of the immune system through normal expression of the golli-mbp gene. <s8> they also establish that this genetic locus, which includes the mbp gene, is conserved among species, providing further evidence that the mbp transcription unit is an integral part of the golli transcription unit and suggest that this structural arrangement is important for the genetic function and/or regulation of these genes.

lp+ss: NR5A2 does not play a role in development of endometrial tissues. <s0> the myc oncogene encodes myc, a transcription factor that binds the genome through sites termed e-boxes (5'-cacgtg-3'), which are identical to the binding sites of the heterodimeric clock-bmal1 master circadian transcription factor. <s1> hence, we hypothesized that ectopic myc expression perturbs the clock by deregulating e-box-driven components of the circadian network in cancer cells. <s2> we report here that deregulated expression of myc or n-myc disrupts the molecular clock in vitro by directly inducing rev-erbα to dampen expression and oscillation of bmal1, and this could be rescued by knockdown of rev-erb. <s3> rev-erbα expression predicts poor clinical outcome for n-myc-driven human neuroblastomas that have diminished bmal1 expression, and re-expression of ectopic bmal1 in neuroblastoma cell lines suppresses their clonogenicity. <s4> further, ectopic myc profoundly alters oscillation of glucose metabolism and perturbs glutaminolysis. <s5> our results demonstrate an unsuspected link between oncogenic transformation and circadian and metabolic dysrhythmia, which we surmise to be advantageous for cancer. 
lp+ss: NR5A2 is important in reverse cholesterol transport in humans. <s0> thyroid hormone (th) is critical for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis during stress responses, but its role in lung fibrosis is unknown. <s1> here we found that the activity and expression of iodothyronine deiodinase 2 (dio2), an enzyme that activates th, were higher in lungs from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis than in control individuals and were correlated with disease severity. <s2> we also found that dio2-knockout mice exhibited enhanced bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. <s3> aerosolized th delivery increased survival and resolved fibrosis in two models of pulmonary fibrosis in mice (intratracheal bleomycin and inducible tgf-β1). <s4> sobetirome, a th mimetic, also blunted bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. <s5> after bleomycin-induced injury, th promoted mitochondrial biogenesis, improved mitochondrial bioenergetics and attenuated mitochondria-regulated apoptosis in alveolar epithelial cells both in vivo and in vitro. <s6> th did not blunt fibrosis in ppargc1a- or pink1-knockout mice, suggesting dependence on these pathways. <s7> we conclude that the antifibrotic properties of th are associated with protection of alveolar epithelial cells and restoration of mitochondrial function and that th may thus represent a potential therapy for pulmonary fibrosis.

lp+ss: Natriuretic peptides protect against diabetes. <s0> post-transcriptional modification of rna nucleosides occurs in all living organisms. <s1> pseudouridine, the most abundant modified nucleoside in non-coding rnas, enhances the function of transfer rna and ribosomal rna by stabilizing the rna structure. <s2> messenger rnas were not known to contain pseudouridine, but artificial pseudouridylation dramatically affects mrna function-it changes the genetic code by facilitating non-canonical base pairing in the ribosome decoding centre. <s3> however, without evidence of naturally occurring mrna pseudouridylation, its physiological relevance was unclear. <s4> here we present a comprehensive analysis of pseudouridylation in saccharomyces cerevisiae and human rnas using pseudo-seq, a genome-wide, single-nucleotide-resolution method for pseudouridine identification. <s5> pseudo-seq accurately identifies known modification sites as well as many novel sites in non-coding rnas, and reveals hundreds of pseudouridylated sites in mrnas. <s6> genetic analysis allowed us to assign most of the new modification sites to one of seven conserved pseudouridine synthases, pus1-4, 6, 7 and 9. <s7> notably, the majority of pseudouridines in mrna are regulated in response to environmental signals, such as nutrient deprivation in yeast and serum starvation in human cells. <s8> these results suggest a mechanism for the rapid and regulated rewiring of the genetic code through inducible mrna modifications. <s9> our findings reveal unanticipated roles for pseudouridylation and provide a resource for identifying the targets of pseudouridine synthases implicated in human disease. 
lp+ss: Natriuretic peptides protect against diabetes. <s0> a number of authors have attempted to defend ecologic (aggregate) studies by claiming that the goal of those studies is estimation of ecologic (contextual or group-level) effects rather than individual-level effects. <s1> critics of these attempts point out that ecologic effect estimates are inevitably used as estimates of individual effects, despite disclaimers. <s2> a more subtle problem is that ecologic variation in the distribution of individual effects can bias ecologic estimates of contextual effects. <s3> the conditions leading to this bias are plausible and perhaps even common in studies of ecosocial factors and health outcomes because social context is not randomized across typical analysis units (administrative regions). <s4> by definition, ecologic data contain only marginal observations on the joint distribution of individually defined confounders and outcomes, and so identify neither contextual nor individual-level effects. <s5> while ecologic studies can still be useful given appropriate caveats, their problems are better addressed by multilevel study designs, which obtain and use individual as well as group-level data. <s6> nonetheless, such studies often share certain special problems with ecologic studies, including problems due to inappropriate aggregation and problems due to temporal changes in covariate distributions.

lp+ss: Nigerian physicians constitue the largest component of sub-Saharan Africa-trained physicians in the United States. <s0> cells of the innate immune system interact with pathogens via conserved pattern-recognition receptors, whereas cells of the adaptive immune system recognize pathogens through diverse, antigen-specific receptors that are generated by somatic dna rearrangement. <s1> invariant natural killer t (inkt) cells are a subset of lymphocytes that bridge the innate and adaptive immune systems. <s2> although inkt cells express t cell receptors that are generated by somatic dna rearrangement, these receptors are semi-invariant and interact with a limited set of lipid and glycolipid antigens, thus resembling the pattern-recognition receptors of the innate immune system. <s3> functionally, inkt cells most closely resemble cells of the innate immune system, as they rapidly elicit their effector functions following activation, and fail to develop immunological memory. <s4> inkt cells can become activated in response to a variety of stimuli and participate in the regulation of various immune responses. <s5> activated inkt cells produce several cytokines with the capacity to jump-start and modulate an adaptive immune response. <s6> a variety of glycolipid antigens that can differentially elicit distinct effector functions in inkt cells have been identified. <s7> these reagents have been employed to test the hypothesis that inkt cells can be harnessed for therapeutic purposes in human diseases. <s8> here, we review the innate-like properties and functions of inkt cells and discuss their interactions with other cell types of the immune system. 
lp+ss: Nigerian physicians constitue the largest component of sub-Saharan Africa-trained physicians in the United States. <s0> background the large-scale emigration of physicians from sub-saharan africa (ssa) to high-income nations is a serious development concern. <s1> our objective was to determine current emigration trends of ssa physicians found in the physician workforce of the united states.  <s2> methods and findings we analyzed physician data from the world health organization (who) global health workforce statistics along with graduation and residency data from the 2011 american medical association physician masterfile (ama-pm) on physicians trained or born in ssa countries who currently practice in the us. <s3> we estimated emigration proportions, year of us entry, years of practice before emigration, and length of time in the us. <s4> according to the 2011 ama-pm, 10,819 physicians were born or trained in 28 ssa countries. <s5> sixty-eight percent (n = 7,370) were ssa-trained, 20% (n = 2,126) were us-trained, and 12% (n = 1,323) were trained outside both ssa and the us. <s6> we estimated active physicians (age ≤ 70 years) to represent 96% (n = 10,377) of the total. <s7> migration trends among ssa-trained physicians increased from 2002 to 2011 for all but one principal source country; the exception was south africa whose physician migration to the us decreased by 8% (-156). <s8> the increase in last-decade migration was >50% in nigeria (+1,113) and ghana (+243), >100% in ethiopia (+274), and >200% (+244) in sudan. <s9> liberia was the most affected by migration to the us with 77% (n = 175) of its estimated physicians in the 2011 ama-pm. <s10> on average, ssa-trained physicians have been in the us for 18 years. <s11> they practiced for 6.5 years before us entry, and nearly half emigrated during the implementation years (1984-1999) of the structural adjustment programs.  <s12> conclusion physician emigration from ssa to the us is increasing for most ssa source countries. <s13> unless far-reaching policies are implemented by the us and ssa countries, the current emigration trends will persist, and the us will remain a leading destination for ssa physicians emigrating from the continent of greatest need. <s14> please see later in the article for the editors' summary. 
lp+ss: Nonhuman primates are incapable of producing neutralizing antibodies in reponse to the Eilat virus (EILV) produced in mosquitos. <s0> traditionally, vaccine development involves tradeoffs between immunogenicity and safety. <s1> live-attenuated vaccines typically offer rapid and durable immunity but have reduced safety when compared to inactivated vaccines. <s2> in contrast, the inability of inactivated vaccines to replicate enhances safety at the expense of immunogenicity, often necessitating multiple doses and boosters. <s3> to overcome these tradeoffs, we developed the insect-specific alphavirus, eilat virus (eilv), as a vaccine platform. <s4> to address the chikungunya fever (chikf) pandemic, we used an eilv cdna clone to design a chimeric virus containing the chikungunya virus (chikv) structural proteins. <s5> the recombinant eilv/chikv was structurally identical at 10 å to wild-type chikv, as determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, and it mimicked the early stages of chikv replication in vertebrate cells from attachment and entry to viral rna delivery. <s6> yet the recombinant virus remained completely defective for productive replication, providing a high degree of safety. <s7> a single dose of eilv/chikv produced in mosquito cells elicited rapid (within 4 d) and long-lasting (>290 d) neutralizing antibodies that provided complete protection in two different mouse models. <s8> in nonhuman primates, eilv/chikv elicited rapid and robust immunity that protected against viremia and telemetrically monitored fever. <s9> our eilv platform represents the first structurally native application of an insect-specific virus in preclinical vaccine development and highlights the potential application of such viruses in vaccinology.

lp+ss: Normal granulomas form in the presence of TNF in Zebrafish. <s0> the archaeal atpase complex pan, the homolog of the eukaryotic 26s proteasome-regulatory atpases, was shown to associate transiently with the 20s proteasome upon binding of atp or atpgammas, but not adp. <s1> by electron microscopy (em), pan appears as a two-ring structure, capping the 20s, and resembles two densities in the 19s complex. <s2> the n termini of the archaeal 20s alpha subunits were found to function as a gate that prevents entry of seven-residue peptides but allows entry of tetrapeptides. <s3> upon association with the 20s particle, pan stimulates gate opening. <s4> although degradation of globular proteins requires atp hydrolysis, the pan-20s complex with atpgammas translocates and degrades unfolded and denatured proteins. <s5> rabbit 26s proteasomes also degrade these unfolded proteins upon atp binding, without hydrolysis. <s6> thus, although unfolding requires energy from atp hydrolysis, atp binding alone supports atpase-20s association, gate opening, and translocation of unfolded substrates into the proteasome, which can occur by facilitated diffusion through the atpase. 
lp+ss: Normal granulomas form in the presence of TNF in Zebrafish. <s0> although genomewide rna expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. <s1> here, we describe a powerful analytical method called gene set enrichment analysis (gsea) for interpreting gene expression data. <s2> the method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. <s3> we demonstrate how gsea yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. <s4> notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, gsea reveals many biological pathways in common. <s5> the gsea method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets. 
lp+ss: Notch signaling occurs between tumor cells and stromal cells. <s0> while significant progress has been made in understanding the induction of tumor vasculature by secreted angiogenic factors, little is known regarding contact-dependent signals that promote tumor angiogenesis. <s1> here, we report that the notch ligand jagged1 induced by growth factors via mitogen-activating protein kinase (mapk) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc) cells triggered notch activation in neighboring endothelial cells (ecs) and promoted capillary-like sprout formation. <s2> jagged1-expressing hnscc cells significantly enhanced neovascularization and tumor growth in vivo. <s3> moreover, the level of jagged1 was significantly correlated with tumor blood vessel content and associated with hnscc development. <s4> our results elucidate a novel mechanism by which the direct interplay between tumor cells and ecs promotes angiogenesis through mapk and notch signaling pathways.

lp+ss: Oat tolerant coeliac patients may have oat specific inflammatory cells in their small bowel mucosa. <s0> immune homeostasis in tissues is achieved through a delicate balance between pathogenic t-cell responses directed at tissue-specific antigens and the ability of the tissue to inhibit these responses. <s1> the mechanisms by which tissues and the immune system communicate to establish and maintain immune homeostasis are currently unknown. <s2> clinical evidence suggests that chronic or repeated exposure to self antigen within tissues leads to an attenuation of pathological autoimmune responses, possibly as a means to mitigate inflammatory damage and preserve function. <s3> many human organ-specific autoimmune diseases are characterized by the initial presentation of the disease being the most severe, with subsequent flares being of lesser severity and duration. <s4> in fact, these diseases often spontaneously resolve, despite persistent tissue autoantigen expression. <s5> in the practice of antigen-specific immunotherapy, allergens or self antigens are repeatedly injected in the skin, with a diminution of the inflammatory response occurring after each successive exposure. <s6> although these findings indicate that tissues acquire the ability to attenuate autoimmune reactions upon repeated responses to antigens, the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. <s7> here we show that upon expression of self antigen in a peripheral tissue, thymus-derived regulatory t cells (treg cells) become activated, proliferate and differentiate into more potent suppressors, which mediate resolution of organ-specific autoimmunity in mice. <s8> after resolution of the inflammatory response, activated treg cells are maintained in the target tissue and are primed to attenuate subsequent autoimmune reactions when antigen is re-expressed. <s9> thus, treg cells function to confer 'regulatory memory' to the target tissue. <s10> these findings provide a framework for understanding how treg cells respond when exposed to self antigen in peripheral tissues and offer mechanistic insight into how tissues regulate autoimmunity. 
lp+ss: Obesity decreases life quality. <s0> objective to determine if n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (pufa) supplementation (versus treatment with n-6 polyunsaturated or other fatty acid supplements) affects the metabolism of osteoarthritic (oa) cartilage.  <s1> methods the metabolic profile of human oa cartilage was determined at the time of harvest and after 24-hour exposure to n-3 pufas or other classes of fatty acids, followed by explant culture for 4 days in the presence or absence of interleukin-1 (il-1). <s2> parameters measured were glycosaminoglycan release, aggrecanase and matrix metalloproteinase (mmp) activity, and the levels of expression of messenger rna (mrna) for mediators of inflammation, aggrecanases, mmps, and their natural tissue inhibitors (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases [timps]).  <s3> results supplementation with n-3 pufa (but not other fatty acids) reduced, in a dose-dependent manner, the endogenous and il-1-induced release of proteoglycan metabolites from articular cartilage explants and specifically abolished endogenous aggrecanase and collagenase proteolytic activity. <s4> similarly, expression of mrna for adamts-4, mmp-13, and mmp-3 (but not timp-1, -2, or -3) was also specifically abolished with n-3 pufa supplementation. <s5> in addition, n-3 pufa supplementation abolished the expression of mrna for mediators of inflammation (cyclooxygenase 2, 5-lipoxygenase, 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein, tumor necrosis factor alpha, il-1alpha, and il-1beta) without affecting the expression of message for several other proteins involved in normal tissue homeostasis.  <s6> conclusion these studies show that the pathologic indicators manifested in human oa cartilage can be significantly altered by exposure of the cartilage to n-3 pufa, but not to other classes of fatty acids.

lp+ss: Occipital activation levels are associated with auditory spatial performance in parietal regions of the brain. <s0> how oncogenic signalling coordinates glycolysis and anabolic biosynthesis in cancer cells remains unclear. <s1> we recently reported that the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (pgam1) regulates anabolic biosynthesis by controlling intracellular levels of its substrate 3-phosphoglycerate and product 2-phosphoglycerate. <s2> here we report a novel mechanism in which y26 phosphorylation enhances pgam1 activation through release of inhibitory e19 that blocks the active site, stabilising cofactor 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate binding and h11 phosphorylation. <s3> we also report the crystal structure of h11-phosphorylated pgam1 and find that phospho-h11 activates pgam1 at least in part by promoting substrate 3-phosphoglycerate binding. <s4> moreover, y26 phosphorylation of pgam1 is common in human cancer cells and contributes to regulation of 3-phosphoglycerate and 2-phosphoglycerate levels, promoting cancer cell proliferation and tumour growth. <s5> as pgam1 is a negative transcriptional target of tp53, and is therefore commonly upregulated in human cancers, these findings suggest that y26 phosphorylation represents an additional acute mechanism underlying phosphoglycerate mutase 1 upregulation.

lp+ss: Omnivores produce more trimethylamine N-oxide from dietary I-carnitine than vegetarians. <s0> the drosophila melanogaster mical protein is essential for the neuronal growth cone machinery that functions through plexin- and semaphorin-mediated axonal signaling. <s1> drosophila mical is also involved in regulating myofilament organization and synaptic structures, and serves as an actin disassembly factor downstream of plexin-mediated axonal repulsion. <s2> in mammalian cells there are three known isoforms, mical1, mical2 and mical3, as well as the mical-like proteins mical-l1 and mical-l2, but little is known of their function, and information comes almost exclusively from neural cells. <s3> in this study we show that in non-neural cells human micals are required for normal actin organization, and all three micals regulate actin stress fibers. <s4> moreover, we provide evidence that the generation of reactive oxygen species by mical proteins is crucial for their actin-regulatory function. <s5> however, although mical1 is auto-inhibited by its c-terminal coiled-coil region, mical2 remains constitutively active and affects stress fibers. <s6> these data suggest differential but complementary roles for mical1 and mical2 in actin microfilament regulation.

lp+ss: Osteoparthritis (OA) is characterized by degeneration of articular cartilage, joint edge, and subchondral bone hyperplasia. <s0> il-10 gene transcription and il-10 protein production was assessed in both type 1 (th1) and type 2 (th2) cd4+ human t cell clones by polymerase chain reaction and elisa, respectively. <s1> although th2 clones apparently showed higher il-10 mrna levels, il-10 mrna expression was consistently found in th1 clones, as well. <s2> likewise, measurable il-10 levels were found in the supernatants of both th1 and th2 clones. <s3> the effect of human il-10 (h-il-10) and viral il-10 (v-il-10) on the proliferative response and cytokine production by th1 and th2 human clones was also investigated. <s4> addition in culture of h-il-10 and v-il-10 significantly reduced the proliferation of both th1 and th2 clones in response to the specific ag and to pha, but it had no inhibitory effect on the proliferative response of th1 and th2 clones to il-2. <s5> h-il-10 and v-il-10 also inhibited the ag-induced production of gamma-interferon (ifn-gamma) by th1 clones and the production of il-4 and il-5 by th2 clones, whereas they had no effect on the cytokine synthesis by the same clones stimulated with pma plus anti-cd3 antibody. <s6> preincubation of apc, but not of clonal t blasts, with h-il-10 resulted in the inhibition of ag-induced proliferation of both th1 and th2 clones, supporting the view that h-il-10 primarily affects apc. <s7> these data demonstrate that, unlike the murine system where il-10 is a product of th2 (but not th1) cells and seems to mainly down-regulate the th1 response, in the human system, il-10 is produced by, and down-regulates the function of, both th1 and th2 cells.

lp+ss: Over half of the gabonese children with Schimmelpenning-Feuerstein-Mims syndrome (SFM) had a plasma lactate of more than 5mmol/L. <s0> neurons and cancer cells use glucose extensively, yet the precise advantage of this adaptation remains unclear. <s1> these two seemingly disparate cell types also show an increased regulation of the apoptotic pathway, which allows for their long-term survival. <s2> here we show that both neurons and cancer cells strictly inhibit cytochrome c-mediated apoptosis by a mechanism dependent on glucose metabolism. <s3> we report that the pro-apoptotic activity of cytochrome c is influenced by its redox state and that increases in reactive oxygen species (ros) following an apoptotic insult lead to the oxidation and activation of cytochrome c. in healthy neurons and cancer cells, however, cytochrome c is reduced and held inactive by intracellular glutathione (gsh), generated as a result of glucose metabolism by the pentose phosphate pathway. <s4> these results uncover a striking similarity in apoptosis regulation between neurons and cancer cells and provide insight into an adaptive advantage offered by the warburg effect for cancer cell evasion of apoptosis and for long-term neuronal survival. 
lp+ss: Overexpressing Cnp1 N-tail variants exacerbates the temperature-sensitive growth defect of scm3-139. <s0> there is considerable variation in opinion about the importance of drug interactions between the combined oral contraceptive pill (cocp) and broad-spectrum antibiotics. <s1> clinical practice varies widely, especially between doctors in europe and those in the us. <s2> rifampicin and griseofulvin induce hepatic enzymes and do appear to have a genuine interaction with the cocp, leading to reduced efficacy. <s3> the situation with the broad-spectrum antibiotics is less clear. <s4> there are relatively few prospective studies of the pharmacokinetics of concurrent cocp and antibiotic use and few, if any, demonstrate a convincing basis for any reduced contraceptive efficacy. <s5> there is evidence, however, that variable contraceptive steroid handling could make some women, at some times, more susceptible to cocp failure. <s6> given the serious consequences of unwanted pregnancy, the cautious approach of using additional or alternative contraception during short courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics and the initial weeks of long-term antibiotic administration may be justified to safeguard the few unidentifiable women who may be at risk. <s7> conflicting opinion and advice is potentially confusing to both professionals and patients, and instructions for additional precautions during and after concurrent cocp and antibiotic use are complicated. <s8> many women are ignorant of, or confused about, the circumstances that can cause oc to fail. <s9> health professionals who prescribe the cocp must continue to strive to educate women about the mode of action and about the times when there is the greatest danger of failure. <s10> professionals who feel that concurrent antibiotic use represents a real threat to contraceptive efficacy of the cocp should be prepared to present the advice for additional contraceptive precautions in a simple and consistent way, backed up with written information and reinforced at regular intervals. 
lp+ss: Overexpressing Cnp1 N-tail variants rescues the temperature-sensitive growth defect of scm3-139. <s0> the mechanisms ensuring specific incorporation of cenp-a at centromeres are poorly understood. <s1> mis16 and mis18 are required for cenp-a localization at centromeres and form a complex that is conserved from fission yeast to human. <s2> fission yeast sim1 mutants that alleviate kinetochore domain silencing are defective in scm3(sp), the ortholog of budding yeast scm3(sc). <s3> scm3(sp) depends on mis16/18 for its centromere localization and like them is recruited to centromeres in late anaphase. <s4> importantly, scm3(sp) coaffinity purifies with cenp-a(cnp1) and associates with cenp-a(cnp1) in vitro, yet localizes independently of intact cenp-a(cnp1) chromatin and is differentially released from chromatin. <s5> while scm3(sc) has been proposed to form a unique hexameric nucleosome with cenp-a(cse4) and histone h4 at budding yeast point centromeres, we favor a model in which scm3(sp) acts as a cenp-a(cnp1) receptor/assembly factor, cooperating with mis16 and mis18 to receive cenp-a(cnp1) from the sim3 escort and mediate assembly of cenp-a(cnp1) into subkinetochore chromatin. 
lp+ss: Oxidative DNA damage activates STING signalling. <s0> melatonin has been shown to have oncostatic effects on malignant melanoma in vitro and in vivo. <s1> we studied the growth suppressive effects of melatonin over a wide range of concentrations in four melanoma cell lines (sbce2, wm-98, wm-164 and skmel-188) representative for different growth stages and phenotype. <s2> melanoma cells were incubated with melatonin 10(-12)-10(-3) m, and proliferation and clonogenicity was assessed at 12 h and 14 days, respectively. <s3> we also determined the expression of cytosolic quinone oxidoreductases nqo1, nqo2 (known as mt3 receptor) and nuclear receptor roralpha by rt-pcr. <s4> melatonin at pharmacological concentrations (10(-3)-10(-7) m) suppressed proliferation in all melanoma cell lines. <s5> in skmel-188 cells cultured in serum-free media, melatonin at low concentrations (10(-12)-10(-10) m) also slightly attenuated the proliferation. <s6> the effects of pharmacological doses of melatonin were confirmed in the clonogenic assay. <s7> expression of nqo1 was detected in all cell lines, whereas nqo2 and nuclear receptor roralpha including its isoform roralpha4 were present only in sbce2, wm-164 and wm-98. <s8> thus, melatonin differentially suppressed proliferation in melanoma cell lines of different behaviour. <s9> the intensity of the oncostatic response to melatonin could be related to the cell-line specific pattern of melatonin cellular receptors and cytosolic binding protein expression. 
lp+ss: Oxidative DNA damage activates STING signalling. <s0> immune sensing of dna is critical for antiviral immunity but can also trigger autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus (le). <s1> here we have provided evidence for the involvement of a damage-associated dna modification in the detection of cytosolic dna. <s2> the oxidized base 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-ohg), a marker of oxidative damage in dna, potentiated cytosolic immune recognition by decreasing its susceptibility to 3' repair exonuclease 1 (trex1)-mediated degradation. <s3> oxidizative modifications arose physiologically in pathogen dna during lysosomal reactive oxygen species (ros) exposure, as well as in neutrophil extracellular trap (net) dna during the oxidative burst. <s4> 8-ohg was also abundant in uv-exposed skin lesions of le patients and colocalized with type i interferon (ifn). <s5> injection of oxidized dna in the skin of lupus-prone mice induced lesions that closely matched respective lesions in patients. <s6> thus, oxidized dna represents a prototypic damage-associated molecular pattern (damp) with important implications for infection, sterile inflammation, and autoimmunity.

lp+ss: PCSK9 inhibitors decrease plasma Lp(a) levels. <s0> background alirocumab, a monoclonal antibody to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (pcsk9), lowers plasma low-density lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol and apolipoprotein b100 (apob). <s1> although studies in mice and cells have identified increased hepatic ldl receptors as the basis for ldl lowering by pcsk9 inhibitors, there have been no human studies characterizing the effects of pcsk9 inhibitors on lipoprotein metabolism. <s2> in particular, it is not known whether inhibition of pcsk9 has any effects on very low-density lipoprotein or intermediate-density lipoprotein (idl) metabolism. <s3> inhibition of pcsk9 also results in reductions of plasma lipoprotein (a) levels. <s4> the regulation of plasma lp(a) levels, including the role of ldl receptors in the clearance of lp(a), is poorly defined, and no mechanistic studies of the lp(a) lowering by alirocumab in humans have been published to date.  <s5> methods eighteen (10 f, 8 mol/l) participants completed a placebo-controlled, 2-period study. <s6> they received 2 doses of placebo, 2 weeks apart, followed by 5 doses of 150 mg of alirocumab, 2 weeks apart. <s7> at the end of each period, fractional clearance rates (fcrs) and production rates (prs) of apob and apo(a) were determined. <s8> in 10 participants, postprandial triglycerides and apob48 levels were measured.  <s9> results alirocumab reduced ultracentrifugally isolated ldl-c by 55.1%, ldl-apob by 56.3%, and plasma lp(a) by 18.7%. <s10> the fall in ldl-apob was caused by an 80.4% increase in ldl-apob fcr and a 23.9% reduction in ldl-apob pr. <s11> the latter was due to a 46.1% increase in idl-apob fcr coupled with a 27.2% decrease in conversion of idl to ldl. <s12> the fcr of apo(a) tended to increase (24.6%) without any change in apo(a) pr. <s13> alirocumab had no effects on fcrs or prs of very low-density lipoproteins-apob and very low-density lipoproteins triglycerides or on postprandial plasma triglycerides or apob48 concentrations.  <s14> conclusions alirocumab decreased ldl-c and ldl-apob by increasing idl- and ldl-apob fcrs and decreasing ldl-apob pr. <s15> these results are consistent with increases in ldl receptors available to clear idl and ldl from blood during pcsk9 inhibition. <s16> the increase in apo(a) fcr during alirocumab treatment suggests that increased ldl receptors may also play a role in the reduction of plasma lp(a).    <s17> clinical trial registration url: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. <s18> unique identifier: nct01959971.

lp+ss: PD-1 triggering on monocytes enhances IL-10 production by monocytes. <s0> viral replication and microbial translocation from the gut to the blood during hiv infection lead to hyperimmune activation, which contributes to the decline in cd4+ t cell numbers during hiv infection. <s1> programmed death-1 (pd-1) and interleukin-10 (il-10) are both upregulated during hiv infection. <s2> blocking interactions between pd-1 and programmed death ligand-1 (pd-l1) and between il-10 and il-10 receptor (il-10r) results in viral clearance and improves t cell function in animal models of chronic viral infections. <s3> here we show that high amounts of microbial products and inflammatory cytokines in the plasma of hiv-infected subjects lead to upregulation of pd-1 expression on monocytes that correlates with high plasma concentrations of il-10. <s4> triggering of pd-1 expressed on monocytes by pd-l1 expressed on various cell types induced il-10 production and led to reversible cd4+ t cell dysfunction. <s5> we describe a new function for pd-1 whereby microbial products inhibit t cell expansion and function by upregulating pd-1 levels and il-10 production by monocytes after binding of pd-1 by pd-l1.

lp+ss: PD-1 triggering on monocytes enhances IL-10 production by monocytes. <s0> the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv) is a major threat to swine health worldwide and is considered the most significant viral disease in the swine industry today. <s1> in past years, studies on the entry of the virus into its host cell have led to the identification of a number of essential virus receptors and entry mediators. <s2> however, viral counterparts for these molecules have remained elusive and this has made rational development of new generation vaccines impossible. <s3> the main objective of this study was to identify the viral counterparts for sialoadhesin, a crucial prrsv receptor on macrophages. <s4> for this purpose, a soluble form of sialoadhesin was constructed and validated. <s5> the soluble sialoadhesin could bind prrsv in a sialic acid-dependent manner and could neutralize prrsv infection of macrophages, thereby confirming the role of sialoadhesin as an essential prrsv receptor on macrophages. <s6> although sialic acids are present on the gp(3), gp(4) and gp(5) envelope glycoproteins, only the m/gp(5) glycoprotein complex of prrsv was identified as a ligand for sialoadhesin. <s7> the interaction was found to be dependent on the sialic acid binding capacity of sialoadhesin and on the presence of sialic acids on gp(5). <s8> these findings not only contribute to a better understanding of prrsv biology, but the knowledge and tools generated in this study also hold the key to the development of a new generation of prrsv vaccines. 
lp+ss: PKG-la does not have a large impact on expression of pain hypersensitivity in PGK-la knockout mice. <s0> synaptic long-term potentiation (ltp) at spinal neurons directly communicating pain-specific inputs from the periphery to the brain has been proposed to serve as a trigger for pain hypersensitivity in pathological states. <s1> previous studies have functionally implicated the nmda receptor-no pathway and the downstream second messenger, cgmp, in these processes. <s2> because cgmp can broadly influence diverse ion-channels, kinases, and phosphodiesterases, pre- as well as post-synaptically, the precise identity of cgmp targets mediating spinal ltp, their mechanisms of action, and their locus in the spinal circuitry are still unclear. <s3> here, we found that protein kinase g1 (pkg-i) localized presynaptically in nociceptor terminals plays an essential role in the expression of spinal ltp. <s4> using the cre-lox p system, we generated nociceptor-specific knockout mice lacking pkg-i specifically in presynaptic terminals of nociceptors in the spinal cord, but not in post-synaptic neurons or elsewhere (sns-pkg-i(-/-) mice). <s5> patch clamp recordings showed that activity-induced ltp at identified synapses between nociceptors and spinal neurons projecting to the periaqueductal grey (pag) was completely abolished in sns-pkg-i(-/-) mice, although basal synaptic transmission was not affected. <s6> analyses of synaptic failure rates and paired-pulse ratios indicated a role for presynaptic pkg-i in regulating the probability of neurotransmitter release. <s7> inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor 1 and myosin light chain kinase were recruited as key phosphorylation targets of presynaptic pkg-i in nociceptive neurons. <s8> finally, behavioural analyses in vivo showed marked defects in sns-pkg-i(-/-) mice in several models of activity-induced nociceptive hypersensitivity, and pharmacological studies identified a clear contribution of pkg-i expressed in spinal terminals of nociceptors. <s9> our results thus indicate that presynaptic mechanisms involving an increase in release probability from nociceptors are operational in the expression of synaptic ltp on spinal-pag projection neurons and that pkg-i localized in presynaptic nociceptor terminals plays an essential role in this process to regulate pain sensitivity.

lp+ss: PKG-la does not have a large impact on expression of spinal long term potentiation in PGK-la knockout mice. <s0> the ontogeny of haematopoietic stem cells (hscs) during embryonic development is still highly debated, especially their possible lineage relationship to vascular endothelial cells. <s1> the first anatomical site from which cells with long-term hsc potential have been isolated is the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (agm), more specifically the vicinity of the dorsal aortic floor. <s2> but although some authors have presented evidence that hscs may arise directly from the aortic floor into the dorsal aortic lumen, others support the notion that hscs first emerge within the underlying mesenchyme. <s3> here we show by non-invasive, high-resolution imaging of live zebrafish embryos, that hscs emerge directly from the aortic floor, through a stereotyped process that does not involve cell division but a strong bending then egress of single endothelial cells from the aortic ventral wall into the sub-aortic space, and their concomitant transformation into haematopoietic cells. <s4> the process is polarized not only in the dorso-ventral but also in the rostro-caudal versus medio-lateral direction, and depends on runx1 expression: in runx1-deficient embryos, the exit events are initially similar, but much rarer, and abort into violent death of the exiting cell. <s5> these results demonstrate that the aortic floor is haemogenic and that hscs emerge from it into the sub-aortic space, not by asymmetric cell division but through a new type of cell behaviour, which we call an endothelial haematopoietic transition.

lp+ss: PKG-la plays an essential role in expression of spinal long term potentiation in PGK-la knockout mice. <s0> here we show that the relaxation induced by stimulation of the vagus nerve in the presence of cholinergic (muscarinic) and adrenergic blockade in the isolated stomach of the guinea pig is mediated by nitric oxide (no). <s1> this is substantiated by inhibition of vagal relaxation by ng-monomethyl-l-arginine, an inhibitor of no synthesis. <s2> the effect of ng-monomethyl-l-arginine was partially reversed by coincubation with l-arginine but not with d-arginine. <s3> no activates soluble guanylate cyclase, and relaxation of the stomach induced by vagal stimulation was prevented by an inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase, methylene blue, further supporting our conclusions. <s4> the relaxant effect of vagal stimulation was also ablated by hexamethonium, an inhibitor of ganglionic nicotinic receptors, thereby showing that ganglionic transmission did not rely on no, through its release from preganglionic neurons. <s5> however, hexamethonium did not inhibit the gastric relaxation brought about by increasing the intragastric pressure, which is also mediated by no as previously described by us. <s6> the selective inhibition by hexamethonium of only the vagally mediated relaxation but not of the pressure-induced relaxation of the stomach indicates the existence of at least two separate neuronal pathways able to generate no and bring about gastric accommodation of food or fluid.

lp+ss: Patients in stable partnerships progress from HIV to death at the same rate as patients not in partnerships. <s0> variant histone h2az-containing nucleosomes are involved in the regulation of gene expression. <s1> in saccharomyces cerevisiae, chromatin deposition of histone h2az is mediated by the fourteen-subunit swr1 complex, which catalyzes atp-dependent exchange of nucleosomal histone h2a for h2az. <s2> previous work defined the role of seven swr1 subunits (swr1 atpase, swc2, swc3, arp6, swc5, yaf9, and swc6) in maintaining complex integrity and h2az histone replacement activity. <s3> here we examined the function of three additional swr1 subunits, bromodomain containing bdf1, actin-related protein arp4 and swc7, by analyzing affinity-purified mutant swr1 complexes. <s4> we observed that depletion of arp4 (arp4-td) substantially impaired the association of bdf1, yaf9, and swc4. <s5> in contrast, loss of either bdf1 or swc7 had minimal effects on overall complex integrity. <s6> furthermore, the basic h2az histone replacement activity of swr1 in vitro required arp4, but not bdf1 or swc7. <s7> thus, three out of fourteen swr1 subunits, bdf1, swc7, and previously noted swc3, appear to have roles auxiliary to the basic histone replacement activity. <s8> the n-terminal region of the swr1 atpase subunit is necessary and sufficient to direct association of bdf1 and swc7, as well as arp4, act1, yaf9 and swc4. <s9> this same region contains an additional h2az-h2b specific binding site, distinct from the previously identified swc2 subunit. <s10> these findings suggest that one swr1 enzyme might be capable of binding two h2az-h2b dimers, and provide further insight on the hierarchy and interdependency of molecular interactions within the swr1 complex.

lp+ss: Patients with common epithelial cancers  are more likely to have an emergency event as their first hospital admission if they live in resource-deprived areas. <s0> virally induced inflammatory responses, beta cell destruction and release of beta cell autoantigens may lead to autoimmune reactions culminating in type 1 diabetes. <s1> therefore, viral capability to induce beta cell death and the nature of virus-induced immune responses are among key determinants of diabetogenic viruses. <s2> we hypothesised that enterovirus infection induces a specific gene expression pattern that results in islet destruction and that such a host response pattern is not shared among all enterovirus infections but varies between virus strains. <s3> the changes in global gene expression and secreted cytokine profiles induced by lytic or benign enterovirus infections were studied in primary human pancreatic islet using dna microarrays and viral strains either isolated at the clinical onset of type 1 diabetes or capable of causing a diabetes-like condition in mice. <s4> the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes (il-1-α, il-1-β and tnf-α) that also mediate cytokine-induced beta cell dysfunction correlated with the lytic potential of a virus. <s5> temporally increasing gene expression levels of double-stranded rna recognition receptors, antiviral molecules, cytokines and chemokines were detected for all studied virus strains. <s6> lytic coxsackievirus b5 (cbv-5)-ds infection also downregulated genes involved in glycolysis and insulin secretion. <s7> the results suggest a distinct, virus-strain-specific, gene expression pattern leading to pancreatic islet destruction and pro-inflammatory effects after enterovirus infection. <s8> however, neither viral replication nor cytotoxic cytokine production alone are sufficient to induce necrotic cell death. <s9> more likely the combined effect of these and possibly cellular energy depletion lie behind the enterovirus-induced necrosis of islets.

lp+ss: Pediatric SCD patients with vaso-occlusive crisis show increased morphine use after breathing 80 ppm iNO for 4 hours. <s0> multidrug resistance remains an unresolved problem in clinical oncology. <s1> over a decade ago genes encoding cellular efflux pumps were shown to confer resistance to a broad spectrum of biochemically unrelated anticancer drugs even before the compounds reached their intracellular targets. <s2> more recently it has become apparent that many drugs induce a common apoptotic program, such that mutations in this program can also produce multidrug resistance. <s3> however, a thorough evaluation of the contribution of apoptotic defects to this "postdamage" drug resistant phenotype is technically complicated, and this has led to uncertainty about the overall significance of apoptosis in therapy-induced cell death. <s4> for example, correlative analyses using patient specimens are limited by unknown background mutations in the biopsy material, and assays using cancer cell lines can be biased by unphysiological conditions. <s5> we sought to circumvent these restrictions by utilizing a tractable transgenic cancer model to examine the impact of apoptosis on treatment outcome. <s6> here we discuss potential caveats of cell culture based assays, highlight features of genetically engineered mice as potential model systems, and describe a tractable transgenic mouse model to study drug responses in a series of primary lymphomas with genetically defined lesions treated at their natural site. 
lp+ss: Peroxynitrite is required for induction of T cell tolerance. <s0> antigen-specific cd8+ t-cell tolerance, induced by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (mdscs), is one of the main mechanisms of tumor escape. <s1> using in vivo models, we show here that mdscs directly disrupt the binding of specific peptide–major histocompatibility complex (pmhc) dimers to cd8-expressing t cells through nitration of tyrosines in a t-cell receptor (tcr)-cd8 complex. <s2> this process makes cd8-expressing t cells unable to bind pmhc and to respond to the specific peptide, although they retain their ability to respond to nonspecific stimulation. <s3> nitration of tcr-cd8 is induced by mdscs through hyperproduction of reactive oxygen species and peroxynitrite during direct cell-cell contact. <s4> molecular modeling suggests specific sites of nitration that might affect the conformational flexibility of tcr-cd8 and its interaction with pmhc. <s5> these data identify a previously unknown mechanism of t-cell tolerance in cancer that is also pertinent to many pathological conditions associated with accumulation of mdscs.

lp+ss: Persister cells provide relapse resistance in cancer patients. <s0> background the pathophysiological mechanism of hyperhomocysteinemia in chronic renal failure in humans is unknown. <s1> the loss of a putative renal homocysteine extraction in chronic renal failure has been hypothesized as significant homocysteine uptake has been demonstrated in the normal rat kidney. <s2> we studied homocysteine extraction in the normal human kidney.  <s3> methods we measured plasma total (free and protein-bound) and free homocysteine (thcy and fhcy, respectively) in arterial and renal venous blood sampled from the aorta and right-side renal vein during cardiac catheterization in 20 fasting patients with normal renal function. <s4> renal homocysteine extraction was calculated as the arteriovenous difference divided by the arterial levels times 100%.  <s5> results no significant renal extraction was demonstrated either for thcy: 0.9% (sd 5.8; 95% ci -1.8 to +3.6) or for fhcy: -0.2% (11.0; -5.4 to +4.9).  <s6> conclusions we conclude that no significant net renal uptake of homocysteine occurs in fasting humans with normal renal function. <s7> the loss of such uptake, therefore, cannot cause hyperhomocysteinemia in patients with renal failure. 
lp+ss: Persister cells provide relapse resistance in cancer patients. <s0> molecular targeted therapy has the potential to dramatically improve survival in patients with cancer. <s1> however, complete and durable responses to targeted therapy are rare in individuals with advanced-stage solid cancers. <s2> even the most effective targeted therapies generally do not induce a complete tumor response, resulting in residual disease and tumor progression that limits patient survival. <s3> we discuss the emerging need to more fully understand the molecular basis of residual disease as a prelude to designing therapeutic strategies to minimize or eliminate residual disease so that we can move from temporary to chronic control of disease, or a cure, for patients with advanced-stage solid cancers. <s4> ultimately, we propose a shift from the current reactive paradigm of analyzing and treating acquired drug resistance to a pre-emptive paradigm of defining the mechanisms that result in residual disease, to target and limit this disease reservoir.

lp+ss: Physical activity level has no association with the difference in maximal oxygen consumption between black and white youth. <s0> notwithstanding the well-characterised roles of a number of oncogenes in neoplastic transformation, micrornas (mirnas) are increasingly implicated in several human cancers. <s1> discovery of mirnas in several oncogenic herpesviruses such as kshv has further highlighted the potential of virus-encoded mirnas to contribute to their oncogenic capabilities. <s2> nevertheless, despite the identification of several possible cancer-related genes as their targets, the direct in vivo role of virus-encoded mirnas in neoplastic diseases such as those induced by kshv is difficult to demonstrate in the absence of suitable models. <s3> however, excellent natural disease models of rapid-onset marek's disease (md) lymphomas in chickens allow examination of the oncogenic potential of virus-encoded mirnas. <s4> using viruses modified by reverse genetics of the infectious bac clone of the oncogenic rb-1b strain of mdv, we show that the deletion of the six-mirna cluster 1 from the viral genome abolished the oncogenicity of the virus. <s5> this loss of oncogenicity appeared to be primarily due to the single mirna within the cluster, mir-m4, the ortholog of cellular mir-155, since its deletion or a 2-nucleotide mutation within its seed region was sufficient to inhibit the induction of lymphomas. <s6> the definitive role of this mir-155 ortholog in oncogenicity was further confirmed by the rescue of oncogenic phenotype by revertant viruses that expressed either the mir-m4 or the cellular homolog gga-mir-155. <s7> this is the first demonstration of the direct in vivo role of a virus-encoded mirna in inducing tumors in a natural infection model. <s8> furthermore, the use of viruses deleted in mirnas as effective vaccines against virulent mdv challenge, enables the prospects of generating genetically defined attenuated vaccines. 
lp+ss: Physical activity level is associated with the difference in maximal oxygen consumption between black and white youth. <s0> objectives despite recognition of the important influence of environmental determinants on physical activity patterns, minimal empirical research has been done to assess the impact of environmental/contextual determinants of physical activity. <s1> this article aims to investigate environmental and sociodemographic determinants of physical activity and inactivity patterns among subpopulations of us adolescents. <s2> we define environmental determinants as modifiable factors in the physical environment that impose a direct influence on the opportunity to engage in physical activity. <s3> the present research examines environmental and sociodemographic determinants of physical activity and inactivity with the implication that these findings can point toward societal-level intervention strategies for increasing physical activity and decreasing inactivity among adolescents.    <s4> study design and methodology the study population consists of nationally representative data from the 1996 national longitudinal study of adolescent health on 17 766 us adolescents enrolled in us middle and high schools (including 3933 non-hispanic blacks, 3148 hispanics, and 1337 asians). <s5> hours/week of inactivity (tv/video viewing and video/computer games) and times/week of moderate to vigorous physical activity were collected by questionnaire. <s6> outcome variables were moderate to vigorous physical activity and inactivity, which were broken into categories (physical activity: 0-2 times/week, 3-4 times/week, and >/=5 times/week; inactivity: 0-10 hours/week, 11-24 hours/week, and >/=25 hours/week). <s7> sociodemographic and environmental correlates of physical activity and inactivity were used as exposure and control variables and included sex, age, urban residence, participation in school physical education program, use of community recreation center, total reported incidents of serious crime in neighborhood, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, generation of residence in the united states, presence of mother/father in household, pregnancy status, work status, in-school status, region, and month of interview. <s8> logistic regression models of high versus low and medium physical activity and inactivity were used to investigate sex and ethnic interactions in relation to environmental and sociodemographic factors to examine evidence for the potential impact of physical education and recreation programs and sociodemographic factors on physical activity and inactivity patterns.  <s9> results moderate to vigorous physical activity was lower and inactivity higher for non-hispanic black and hispanic adolescents. <s10> participation in school physical education programs was considerably low for these adolescents and decreased with age. <s11> participation in daily school physical education (pe) program classes (adjusted odds ratio [aor]: 2.21; confidence interval [ci]: 1.82-2.68) and use of a community recreation center (aor: 1.75; ci: 1.56-1.96) were associated with an increased likelihood of engaging in high level moderate to vigorous physical activity. <s12> maternal education was inversely associated with high inactivity patterns; for example, having a mother with a graduate or professional degree was associated with an aor of.61 (ci:.48-.76) for high inactivity. <s13> high family income was associated with increased moderate to vigorous physical activity (aor: 1.43; ci: 1.22-1.67) and decreased inactivity (aor:.70; ci:.59-.82). <s14> high neighborhood serious crime level was associated with a decreased likelihood of falling in the highest category of moderate to vigorous physical activity (aor:.77; ci:.66-.91).  <s15> conclusions these results show important associations between modifiable environmental factors, such as participation in school pe and community recreation programs, with activity patterns of adolescents. <s16> despite the marked and significant impact of participation in school pe programs on physical activity patterns of us adolescents, few adolescents participated in such school pe programs; only 21.3% of all adolescents

lp+ss: Piezo1 channels are sensors for cell migration in epithelial cells. <s0> frailty has long been considered synonymous with disability and comorbidity, to be highly prevalent in old age and to confer a high risk for falls, hospitalization and mortality. <s1> however, it is becoming recognized that frailty may be a distinct clinical syndrome with a biological basis. <s2> the frailty process appears to be a transitional state in the dynamic progression from robustness to functional decline. <s3> during this process, total physiological reserves decrease and become less likely to be sufficient for the maintenance and repair of the ageing body. <s4> central to the clinical concept of frailty is that no single altered system alone defines it, but that multiple systems are involved. <s5> clinical consensus regarding the phenotype which constitutes frailty, drawing upon the opinions of numerous authors, shows the characteristics to include wasting (loss of both muscle mass and strength and weight loss), loss of endurance, decreased balance and mobility, slowed performance, relative inactivity and, potentially, decreased cognitive function. <s6> frailty is a distinct entity easily recognized by clinicians, with multiple manifestations and with no single symptom being sufficient or essential in its presentation. <s7> manifestations include appearance (consistent or not with age), nutritional status (thin, weight loss), subjective health rating (health perception), performance (cognition, fatigue), sensory/physical impairments (vision, hearing, strength) and current care (medication, hospital). <s8> although the early stages of the frailty process may be clinically silent, when depleted reserves reach an aggregate threshold leading to serious vulnerability, the syndrome may become detectable by looking at clinical, functional, behavioral and biological markers. <s9> thus, a better understanding of these clinical changes and their underlying mechanisms, beginning in the pre-frail state, may confirm the impression held by many geriatricians that increasing frailty is distinguishable from ageing and in consequence is potentially reversible. <s10> we therefore provide an update of the physiopathology and clinical and biological characteristics of the frailty process and speculate on possible preventative approaches.

lp+ss: Pioglitazone use is not associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. <s0> the intracellular ca(2+) concentration of many nonexcitable cells is regulated by calcium store release and store-operated calcium entry (soce). <s1> in platelets, stim1 was recently identified as the main calcium sensor expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum. <s2> to evaluate the role of the soc channel moiety, orai1, in platelet soce, we generated mice expressing a mutated, inactive form of orai1 in blood cells only (orai1(r93w)). <s3> platelets expressing orai1(r93w) were characterized by markedly reduced soce and impaired agonist-induced increases in [ca(2+)](i). <s4> orai1(r93w) platelets showed reduced integrin activation and impaired degranulation when stimulated with low agonist concentrations under static conditions. <s5> this defect, however, did not significantly affect the ability of orai1(r93w) platelets to aggregate or to adhere to collagen under arterial flow conditions ex vivo. <s6> in contrast, these adherent orai1(r93w) platelets were defective in surface phosphatidylserine exposure, suggesting that orai1 is crucial for the platelets' procoagulant response rather than for other ca(2+)-dependent cellular responses.

lp+ss: Polymeal nutrition increases cardiovascular mortality. <s0> developmental abnormalities, cancer, and premature aging each have been linked to defects in the dna damage response (ddr). <s1> mutations in the atr checkpoint regulator cause developmental defects in mice (pregastrulation lethality) and humans (seckel syndrome). <s2> here we show that eliminating atr in adult mice leads to defects in tissue homeostasis and the rapid appearance of age-related phenotypes, such as hair graying, alopecia, kyphosis, osteoporosis, thymic involution, fibrosis, and other abnormalities. <s3> histological and genetic analyses indicate that atr deletion causes acute cellular loss in tissues in which continuous cell proliferation is required for maintenance. <s4> importantly, thymic involution, alopecia, and hair graying in atr knockout mice were associated with dramatic reductions in tissue-specific stem and progenitor cells and exhaustion of tissue renewal and homeostatic capacity. <s5> in aggregate, these studies suggest that reduced regenerative capacity in adults via deletion of a developmentally essential ddr gene is sufficient to cause the premature appearance of age-related phenotypes. 
lp+ss: Polymeal nutrition increases cardiovascular mortality. <s0> the unicellular eukaryotic organisms represent the popular model systems to understand aging in eukaryotes. <s1> candida albicans, a polymorphic fungus, appears to be another distinctive unicellular aging model in addition to the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe. <s2> the two types of candida cells, yeast (blastospore) form and hyphal (filamentous) form, have similar replicative lifespan. <s3> taking the advantage of morphologic changes, we are able to obtain cells of different ages. <s4> old candida cells tend to accumulate glycogen and oxidatively damaged proteins. <s5> deletion of the sir2 gene causes a decrease of lifespan, while insertion of an extra copy of sir2 extends lifespan, indicating that like in s. cerevisiae, sir2 regulates cellular aging in c. albicans. <s6> interestingly, sir2 deletion does not result in the accumulation of extra-chromosomal rdna molecules, but influences the retention of oxidized proteins in mother cells, suggesting that the extra-chromosomal rdna molecules may not be associated with cellular aging in c. albicans. <s7> this novel aging model, which allows efficient large-scale isolation of old cells, may facilitate biochemical characterizations and genomics/proteomics studies of cellular aging, and help to verify the aging pathways observed in other organisms including s. cerevisiae.

lp+ss: Post-transcriptional handling of mitochondrial transcripts occurs in mitochondrial RNA granules. <s0> rna-binding proteins are at the heart of posttranscriptional gene regulation, coordinating the processing, storage, and handling of cellular rnas. <s1> we show here that grsf1, previously implicated in the binding and selective translation of influenza mrnas, is targeted to mitochondria where it forms granules that colocalize with foci of newly synthesized mtrna next to mitochondrial nucleoids. <s2> grsf1 preferentially binds rnas transcribed from three contiguous genes on the light strand of mtdna, the nd6 mrna, and the long noncoding rnas for cytb and nd5, each of which contains multiple consensus binding sequences. <s3> rnai-mediated knockdown of grsf1 leads to alterations in mitochondrial rna stability, abnormal loading of mrnas and lncrnas on the mitochondrial ribosome, and impaired ribosome assembly. <s4> this results in a specific protein synthesis defect and a failure to assemble normal amounts of the oxidative phosphorylation complexes. <s5> these data implicate grsf1 as a key regulator of posttranscriptional mitochondrial gene expression.

lp+ss: Post-transcriptional handling of mitochondrial transcripts occurs in mitochondrial RNA granules. <s0> human mitochondrial ribosomes are specialized in the synthesis of 13 proteins, which are fundamental components of the oxidative phosphorylation system. <s1> the pathway of mitoribosome biogenesis, the compartmentalization of the process, and factors involved remain largely unknown. <s2> here, we have identified the dead-box protein ddx28 as an rna granule component essential for the biogenesis of the mitoribosome large subunit (mt-lsu). <s3> ddx28 interacts with the 16s rrna and the mt-lsu. <s4> rnai-mediated ddx28 silencing in hek293t cells does not affect mitochondrial mrna stability or 16s rrna processing or modification. <s5> however, it leads to reduced levels of 16s rrna and mt-lsu proteins, impaired mt-lsu assembly, deeply attenuated mitochondrial protein synthesis, and consequent failure to assemble oxidative phosphorylation complexes. <s6> our findings identify ddx28 as essential during the early stages of mitoribosome mt-lsu biogenesis, a process that takes place mainly near the mitochondrial nucleoids, in the compartment defined by the rna granules.

lp+ss: Post-transcriptional handling of mitochondrial transcripts occurs in mitochondrial RNA granules. <s0> melatonin has been shown to have oncostatic effects on malignant melanoma in vitro and in vivo. <s1> we studied the growth suppressive effects of melatonin over a wide range of concentrations in four melanoma cell lines (sbce2, wm-98, wm-164 and skmel-188) representative for different growth stages and phenotype. <s2> melanoma cells were incubated with melatonin 10(-12)-10(-3) m, and proliferation and clonogenicity was assessed at 12 h and 14 days, respectively. <s3> we also determined the expression of cytosolic quinone oxidoreductases nqo1, nqo2 (known as mt3 receptor) and nuclear receptor roralpha by rt-pcr. <s4> melatonin at pharmacological concentrations (10(-3)-10(-7) m) suppressed proliferation in all melanoma cell lines. <s5> in skmel-188 cells cultured in serum-free media, melatonin at low concentrations (10(-12)-10(-10) m) also slightly attenuated the proliferation. <s6> the effects of pharmacological doses of melatonin were confirmed in the clonogenic assay. <s7> expression of nqo1 was detected in all cell lines, whereas nqo2 and nuclear receptor roralpha including its isoform roralpha4 were present only in sbce2, wm-164 and wm-98. <s8> thus, melatonin differentially suppressed proliferation in melanoma cell lines of different behaviour. <s9> the intensity of the oncostatic response to melatonin could be related to the cell-line specific pattern of melatonin cellular receptors and cytosolic binding protein expression.

lp+ss: Pre-mRNAs associated with spliceosomal components are more stable than unassociated splicing substrates. <s0> the development of in vitro assays to analyze pre-mrna splicing resulted in the discovery of many fundamental features characterizing splicing signals and the machinery that completes this process. <s1> because in vitro assays can be manipulated by various biochemical approaches, the versatility of investigating alternative pre-mrna splicing in the test tube appears endless. <s2> importantly, modifications in reaction conditions can lead to the accumulation, isolation, and characterization of reaction intermediates, a prerequisite for gaining mechanistic insights into how the spliceosome carries out intron removal, and how regulatory elements assist the general splicing machinery in defining splice sites and alternative exons. <s3> these considerable experimental advantages have made the in vitro splicing system a standard assay, even though this approach is independent from rna transcription and other rna processing events, and in some respects deviates from the natural process of mrna biogenesis. <s4> here, we describe the tools and techniques necessary to carry out in vitro splicing assays. <s5> analyses of various experimental designs are presented to highlight the approaches taken to gain insights into the mechanisms by which splice site recognition and activation are communicated with the general splicing machinery. <s6> methods to measure the kinetics of splicing, to observe the formation of the pre-spliceosomal complexes, and to manipulate and modify the in vitro system to resolve the regulatory influences in alternative splicing are presented. 
lp+ss: Pre-mRNAs associated with spliceosomal components are more stable than unassociated splicing substrates. <s0> whole cell patch-clamp recordings were made from sympathetic preganglionic neurons (spns) in the intermediolateral cell column of thoracolumbar spinal cord slices of 12- to 16-day-old rats, and the effects of pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (pacap)-38 on n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda)- and kainate (ka)-induced inward currents were examined. <s1> pacap, in concentrations (10-30 nm) that caused no significant change of holding currents, reversibly increased nmda-induced currents but not ka-induced currents. <s2> at higher concentrations (>30 nm), the peptide produced a sustained inward current. <s3> the potentiating effect of pacap was nullified by prior incubation of the slices with the adenylate cyclase inhibitor mdl-12,330a (25 microm). <s4> further, superfusing the slices with the membrane-permeable cyclic amp analogue n6,2'-o-dibutyryladenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (100-300 microm) in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (700 microm) increased the nmda currents. <s5> this result suggests that pacap selectively increases nmda-receptor-mediated responses in the rat spns, probably via a cyclic-amp-dependent mechanism, providing evidence that the peptide may be involved in synaptic plasticity. 
lp+ss: Pre-mRNAs associated with spliceosomal components are more stable than unassociated splicing substrates. <s0> down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (dscam) seems likely to play a key role in the "alternative adaptive immunity" that has been reported in invertebrates. <s1> dscam consists of a cytoplasmic tail that is involved in signal transduction and a hypervariable extracellular region that might use a pathogen recognition mechanism similar to that used by the vertebrate antibodies. <s2> in our previous paper, we isolated a unique tail-less form of dscam from litopenaeus vannamei. <s3> in this study, we report the first membrane-bound form of shrimp dscam: pmdscam was isolated from penaeus monodon, and it occurred in both membrane-bound and tail-less forms. <s4> phylogenetic analysis showed that while the crustacean dscams from shrimp and water flea did not share a single subclade, they were distinct from the invertebrate dscam-like molecules and from the insecta dscams. <s5> in the extracellular region, the variable regions of pmdscam were located in n-terminal ig2, n-terminal ig3 and the entire ig7 domain. <s6> the pmdscam extracellular variants and transmembrane domain variants were produced by mutually exclusive alternative splicing events. <s7> the cytoplasmic tail variants were produced by exon inclusion/exclusion. <s8> based on the genomic organization of daphnia dscam's cytoplasmic tail, we propose a model of how the shrimp dscam genomic locus might use type iii polyadenylation to generate both the tail-less and membrane-bound forms.

lp+ss: Primary cervical cancer screening with HPV detection has lower longitudinal sensitivity than conventional cytology to detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2. <s0> actin and its key regulatory component, cofilin, are found together in large rod-shaped assemblies in neurons subjected to energy stress. <s1> such inclusions are also enriched in alzheimer's disease brain, and appear in transgenic models of neurodegeneration. <s2> neuronal insults, such as energy loss and/or oxidative stress, result in rapid dephosphorylation of the cellular cofilin pool prior to its assembly into rod-shaped inclusions. <s3> although these events implicate a role for phosphatases in cofilin rod formation, a mechanism linking energy stress, phosphocofilin turnover, and subsequent rod assembly has been elusive. <s4> we demonstrate the atp-sensitive interaction of the cofilin phosphatase chronophin (cin) with the chaperone hsp90 to form a biosensor that mediates cofilin/actin rod formation. <s5> our results suggest a model whereby attenuated interactions between cin and hsp90 during atp depletion enhance cin-dependent cofilin dephosphorylation and consequent rod assembly, thereby providing a mechanism for the formation of pathological actin/cofilin aggregates during neurodegenerative energy flux.

lp+ss: Propriospinal interneurons that play a role in the plastic reorganization of spinal circuits are integral for recovery from spinal cord injury. <s0> spinal cord injuries (scis) in humans and experimental animals are often associated with varying degrees of spontaneous functional recovery during the first months after injury. <s1> such recovery is widely attributed to axons spared from injury that descend from the brain and bypass incomplete lesions, but its mechanisms are uncertain. <s2> to investigate the neural basis of spontaneous recovery, we used kinematic, physiological and anatomical analyses to evaluate mice with various combinations of spatially and temporally separated lateral hemisections with or without the excitotoxic ablation of intrinsic spinal cord neurons. <s3> we show that propriospinal relay connections that bypass one or more injury sites are able to mediate spontaneous functional recovery and supraspinal control of stepping, even when there has been essentially total and irreversible interruption of long descending supraspinal pathways in mice. <s4> our findings show that pronounced functional recovery can occur after severe sci without the maintenance or regeneration of direct projections from the brain past the lesion and can be mediated by the reorganization of descending and propriospinal connections. <s5> targeting interventions toward augmenting the remodeling of relay connections may provide new therapeutic strategies to bypass lesions and restore function after sci and in other conditions such as stroke and multiple sclerosis.

lp+ss: Pseudogene PTENP1 encodes a transcript that regulates PTEN expression. <s0> the canonical role of messenger rna (mrna) is to deliver protein-coding information to sites of protein synthesis. <s1> however, given that micrornas bind to rnas, we hypothesized that rnas could possess a regulatory role that relies on their ability to compete for microrna binding, independently of their protein-coding function. <s2> as a model for the protein-coding-independent role of rnas, we describe the functional relationship between the mrnas produced by the pten tumour suppressor gene and its pseudogene ptenp1 and the critical consequences of this interaction. <s3> we find that ptenp1 is biologically active as it can regulate cellular levels of pten and exert a growth-suppressive role. <s4> we also show that the ptenp1 locus is selectively lost in human cancer. <s5> we extended our analysis to other cancer-related genes that possess pseudogenes, such as oncogenic kras. <s6> we also demonstrate that the transcripts of protein-coding genes such as pten are biologically active. <s7> these findings attribute a novel biological role to expressed pseudogenes, as they can regulate coding gene expression, and reveal a non-coding function for mrnas.

lp+ss: Pseudogene PTENP1 encodes a transcript that regulates PTEN expression. <s0> generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (ipscs) by somatic cell reprogramming involves global epigenetic remodelling. <s1> whereas several proteins are known to regulate chromatin marks associated with the distinct epigenetic states of cells before and after reprogramming, the role of specific chromatin-modifying enzymes in reprogramming remains to be determined. <s2> to address how chromatin-modifying proteins influence reprogramming, we used short hairpin rnas (shrnas) to target genes in dna and histone methylation pathways, and identified positive and negative modulators of ipsc generation. <s3> whereas inhibition of the core components of the polycomb repressive complex 1 and 2, including the histone 3 lysine 27 methyltransferase ezh2, reduced reprogramming efficiency, suppression of suv39h1, yy1 and dot1l enhanced reprogramming. <s4> specifically, inhibition of the h3k79 histone methyltransferase dot1l by shrna or a small molecule accelerated reprogramming, significantly increased the yield of ipsc colonies, and substituted for klf4 and c-myc (also known as myc). <s5> inhibition of dot1l early in the reprogramming process is associated with a marked increase in two alternative factors, nanog and lin28, which play essential functional roles in the enhancement of reprogramming. <s6> genome-wide analysis of h3k79me2 distribution revealed that fibroblast-specific genes associated with the epithelial to mesenchymal transition lose h3k79me2 in the initial phases of reprogramming. <s7> dot1l inhibition facilitates the loss of this mark from genes that are fated to be repressed in the pluripotent state. <s8> these findings implicate specific chromatin-modifying enzymes as barriers to or facilitators of reprogramming, and demonstrate how modulation of chromatin-modifying enzymes can be exploited to more efficiently generate ipscs with fewer exogenous transcription factors. 
lp+ss: Pure neural progenitor cell (NPC) populations can only be obtained from cell cultures that undergo passaging, filtration, or other isolation and cell sorting methods. <s0> bacteriophages (phages) modify microbial communities by lysing hosts, transferring genetic material, and effecting lysogenic conversion. <s1> to understand how natural communities are affected it is important to develop predictive models. <s2> here we consider how variation between models-in eclipse period, latent period, adsorption constant, burst size, the handling of differences in host quantity and host quality, and in modeling strategy-can affect predictions. <s3> first we compare two published models of phage growth, which differ primarily in terms of how they model the kinetics of phage adsorption; one is a computer simulation and the other is an explicit calculation. <s4> at higher host quantities (approximately 10(8) cells/ml), both models closely predict experimentally determined phage population growth rates. <s5> at lower host quantities (10(7) cells/ml), the computer simulation continues to closely predict phage growth rates, but the explicit model does not. <s6> next we concentrate on predictions of latent-period optima. <s7> a latent-period optimum is the latent period that maximizes the population growth of a specific phage growing in the presence of a specific quantity and quality of host cells. <s8> both models predict similar latent-period optima at higher host densities (e.g., 17 min at 10(8) cells/ml). <s9> at lower host densities, however, the computer simulation predicts latent-period optima that are much shorter than those suggested by explicit calculations (e.g., 90 versus 1,250 min at 10(5) cells/ml). <s10> finally, we consider the impact of host quality on phage latent-period evolution. <s11> by taking care to differentiate latent-period phenotypic plasticity from latent-period evolution, we argue that the impact of host quality on phage latent-period evolution may be relatively small.

lp+ss: Pyridostatin prevents double-strand breaks accumulation. <s0> falciparum malaria kills, and it particularly kills the rural poor. <s1> artemisinin derivatives, such as artesunate, are a vital component of plasmodium falciparum malaria treatment and control in the face of globally increasing antimalarial drug resistance. <s2> since 1998 a worsening epidemic of sophisticated counterfeit "artesunate" tablets (containing no artesunate) has plagued mainland southeast asia (see figure s1). <s3> in some countries, most of the available artesunate is fake [ 1–5].  <s4> artemisinin derivatives are remarkably rapid in their antimalarial effects, and they are very well tolerated. <s5> so where these medicines are available, they are sought after. <s6> but as they are relatively expensive, a demand is created for cheaper versions amongst the poorest and most vulnerable people, upon whom the counterfeiters have preyed–with fatal results. 
lp+ss: Pyridostatin prevents double-strand breaks accumulation. <s0> several data suggest that fermentable dietary fiber could play a role in the control of obesity and associated metabolic disorders. <s1> the aim of this study was to investigate the putative role of short chain fructo-oligosaccharide (ofs) - a non-digestible oligosaccharide - in mice fed a standard diet and in mice fed two distinct high fat diets inducing metabolic disorders associated to obesity. <s2> we confirmed, in mice, several effects previously shown in rats fed a standard diet enriched with ofs, namely an increase in total and empty caecum weight, a significant decrease in epididymal fat mass, and an increase in colonic and portal plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 (glp-1), a phenomenon positively correlated with a higher colonic proglucagon mrna level. <s3> curiously, 4-week treatment with ofs added at the same dose induced different effects when added in the two different high fat diets. <s4> ofs decreased energy intake, body weight gain, glycemia, and epididymal fat mass only when added together with the high fat-carbohydrate free diet, in which ofs promoted colonic proglucagon expression and insulin secretion. <s5> our results support an association between the increase in proglucagon expression in the proximal colon and ofs effects on glycemia, fat mass development, and/or body weight gain. <s6> in conclusion, dietary oligosaccharides would constitute an interesting class of dietary fibers promoting, in certain conditions, endogenous glp-1 production, with beneficial physiological consequences. <s7> this remains to be proven in human studies.

lp+ss: Pyridostatin reduces proliferation of homologous recombination - defective cells. <s0> ghrelin, an octanoylated peptide hormone produced in the stomach, rises dramatically in mouse plasma during chronic severe calorie deprivation, an event that is essential to maintain life. <s1> the mechanism for this increase is not understood. <s2> here, we study the control of ghrelin secretion in tissue culture cells derived from mice bearing ghrelinomas induced by a tissue-specific sv40 t-antigen transgene. <s3> we found that the ghrelin-secreting cells express high levels of mrna encoding beta(1)-adrenergic receptors. <s4> addition of norepinephrine or epinephrine to the culture medium stimulated ghrelin secretion, and this effect was blocked by atenolol, a selective beta(1)-adrenergic antagonist. <s5> when wt mice were treated with reserpine to deplete adrenergic neurotransmitters from sympathetic neurons, the fasting-induced increase in plasma ghrelin was blocked. <s6> inhibition was also seen following atenolol administration. <s7> we conclude that ghrelin secretion during fasting is induced by adrenergic agents released by sympathetic neurons and acting directly on beta(1) receptors on the ghrelin-secreting cells of the stomach.

lp+ss: R2D2 stops miRNA production by increasing the selectivity of Dcr2 for long dsRNA. <s0> cystic fibrosis (cf) is an inherited pleiotropic disease that results from abnormalities in the gene codes of a chloride channel. <s1> the lungs of cf patients are chronically infected by several pathogens but bacteraemia have rarely been reported in this pathology. <s2> besides that, circulating monocytes in cf patients exhibit a patent endotoxin tolerance (et) state since they show a significant reduction of the inflammatory response to bacterial stimulus. <s3> despite a previous description of this phenomenon, the direct cause of et in cf patients remains unknown. <s4> in this study we have researched the possible role of microbial/endotoxin translocation from a localized infection to the bloodstream as a potential cause of et induction in cf patients. <s5> plasma analysis of fourteen cf patients revealed high levels of lps compared to healthy volunteers and patients who suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. <s6> experiments in vitro showed that endotoxin concentrations found in plasma of cf patients were enough to induce an et phenotype in monocytes from healthy controls. <s7> in agreement with clinical data, we failed to detect bacterial dna in cf plasma. <s8> our results suggest that soluble endotoxin present in bloodstream of cf patients causes endotoxin tolerance in their circulating monocytes. 
lp+ss: RA activation of DIF2 and NB4 cells induces hallmarks of transcriptionally active promoters. <s0> nuclear receptors undergo ligand-dependent conformational changes that are required for corepressor-coactivator exchange, but whether there is an actual requirement for specific epigenetic landmarks to impose ligand dependency for gene activation remains unknown. <s1> here we report an unexpected and general strategy that is based on the requirement for specific cohorts of inhibitory histone methyltransferases (hmts) to impose gene-specific gatekeeper functions that prevent unliganded nuclear receptors and other classes of regulated transcription factors from binding to their target gene promoters and causing constitutive gene activation in the absence of stimulating signals. <s2> this strategy, based at least in part on an hmt-dependent inhibitory histone code, imposes a requirement for specific histone demethylases, including lsd1, to permit ligand- and signal-dependent activation of regulated gene expression. <s3> these events link an inhibitory methylation component of the histone code to a broadly used strategy that circumvents pathological constitutive gene induction by physiologically regulated transcription factors. 
lp+ss: RAD52 is involved in break-induced DNA replication (BIR). <s0> human cancers are characterized by the presence of oncogene-induced dna replication stress (drs), making them dependent on repair pathways such as break-induced replication (bir) for damaged dna replication forks. <s1> to better understand bir, we performed a targeted sirna screen for genes whose depletion inhibited g1 to s phase progression when oncogenic cyclin e was overexpressed. <s2> rad52, a gene dispensable for normal development in mice, was among the top hits. <s3> in cells in which fork collapse was induced by oncogenes or chemicals, the rad52 protein localized to drs foci. <s4> depletion of rad52 by sirna or knockout of the gene by crispr/cas9 compromised restart of collapsed forks and led to dna damage in cells experiencing drs. <s5> furthermore, in cancer-prone, heterozygous apc mutant mice, homozygous deletion of the rad52 gene suppressed tumor growth and prolonged lifespan. <s6> we therefore propose that mammalian rad52 facilitates repair of collapsed dna replication forks in cancer cells.

lp+ss: RANK-RANKL pathway signalling has no known association with development of Aire-expressing medullary thymic epithelial cells. <s0> human topbp1 is a major player in the control of the dna replication checkpoint. <s1> in this study, we identified mdc1, a key checkpoint protein involved in the cellular response to dna double-strand breaks, as a topbp1-associated protein. <s2> the specific topbp1-mdc1 interaction is mediated by the fifth brct domain of topbp1 and the ser-asp-thr (sdt) repeats of mdc1. <s3> in addition, we demonstrated that topbp1 accumulation at stalled replication forks is promoted by the h2ax/mdc1 signaling cascade. <s4> moreover, mdc1 is important for atr-dependent chk1 activation in response to replication stress. <s5> collectively, our data suggest that mdc1 facilitates several important steps in both cellular dna damage response and the dna replication checkpoint.

lp+ss: RANK-RANKL pathway signalling is linked to development of Aire-expressing medullary thymic epithelial cells. <s0> the thymic medulla provides a specialized microenvironment for the negative selection of t cells, with the presence of autoimmune regulator (aire)-expressing medullary thymic epithelial cells (mtecs) during the embryonic-neonatal period being both necessary and sufficient to establish long-lasting tolerance. <s1> here we showed that emergence of the first cohorts of aire(+) mtecs at this key developmental stage, prior to αβ t cell repertoire selection, was jointly directed by rankl(+) lymphoid tissue inducer cells and invariant vγ5(+) dendritic epidermal t cell (detc) progenitors that are the first thymocytes to express the products of gene rearrangement. <s2> in turn, generation of aire(+) mtecs then fostered skint-1-dependent, but aire-independent, detc progenitor maturation and the emergence of an invariant detc repertoire. <s3> hence, our data attributed a functional importance to the temporal development of vγ5(+) γδ t cells during thymus medulla formation for αβ t cell tolerance induction and demonstrated a rank-mediated reciprocal link between detc and aire(+) mtec maturation.

lp+ss: RANK-RANKL pathway signalling is linked to development of Aire-expressing medullary thymic epithelial cells. <s0> medullary thymic epithelial cells (mtecs) establish t cell self-tolerance through the expression of autoimmune regulator (aire) and peripheral tissue-specific self-antigens. <s1> however, signals underlying mtec development remain largely unclear. <s2> here, we demonstrate crucial regulation of mtec development by receptor activator of nf-kappab (rank) and cd40 signals. <s3> whereas only rank signaling was essential for mtec development during embryogenesis, in postnatal mice, cooperation between cd40 and rank signals was required for mtec development to successfully establish the medullary microenvironment. <s4> ligation of rank or cd40 on fetal thymic stroma in vitro induced mtec development in a tumor necrosis factor-associated factor 6 (traf6)-, nf-kappab inducing kinase (nik)-, and ikappab kinase beta (ikkbeta)-dependent manner. <s5> these results show that developmental-stage-dependent cooperation between rank and cd40 promotes mtec development, thereby establishing self-tolerance.

lp+ss: RTEL1 interacts with TRF2 through a C4C4 motif <s0> the helicase rtel1 promotes t-loop unwinding and suppresses telomere fragility to maintain the integrity of vertebrate telomeres. <s1> an interaction between rtel1 and pcna is important to prevent telomere fragility, but how rtel1 engages with the telomere to promote t-loop unwinding is unclear. <s2> here, we establish that the shelterin protein trf2 recruits rtel1 to telomeres in s phase, which is required to prevent catastrophic t-loop processing by structure-specific nucleases. <s3> we show that the trf2-rtel1 interaction is mediated by a metal-coordinating c4c4 motif in rtel1, which is compromised by the hoyeraal-hreidarsson syndrome (hhs) mutation, rtel1(r1264h). <s4> conversely, we define a trf2(i124d) substitution mutation within the trfh domain of trf2, which eliminates rtel1 binding and phenocopies the rtel1(r1264h) mutation, giving rise to aberrant t-loop excision, telomere length heterogeneity, and loss of the telomere as a circle. <s5> these results implicate trf2 in the recruitment of rtel1 to facilitate t-loop disassembly at telomeres in s phase.

lp+ss: RUNX1 is downregulated or mutated in TLX1 T-ALL. <s0> sporophytic self-incompatibility (ssi) is a self-pollen recognition system that enforces outcrossing in plants. <s1> recognition in ssi systems is typically controlled by a complex locus (5-locus) with separate genes that determine pollen and stigma specificity. <s2> experimental studies show that s-alleles can be dominant, recessive, or codominant, and that the dominance level of a given s-allele can depend upon whether pollen or stigma specificity is examined. <s3> here and in the companion paper by llaurens and colleagues, the evolution of dominance in single-locus ssi is explored using numerical models and simulation. <s4> particular attention is directed at factors that can cause s-allele dominance to differ in pollen versus stigma. <s5> the effect of recombination between the s-locus and modifier locus is also examined. <s6> the models predict that limitation in the number of compatible mates is required for the evolution of s-allele dominance in the stigma but not in the pollen. <s7> tight linkage between the s-locus and modifier promotes the evolution of s-allele dominance hierarchies. <s8> model results are interpreted with respect to published information on the molecular basis of dominance in ssi systems, and reported s-allele dominance relationships in a variety of species. <s9> these studies show that dominant s-alleles are more common in the pollen than in the stigma, a pattern that when interpreted in light of model predictions, suggests that mate limitation may be relatively infrequent in natural populations with ssi.

lp+ss: Rapid phosphotransfer rates are correlated with histidine kinase regulator specificity. <s0> two-component signal transduction pathways comprising histidine protein kinases (hpks) and their response regulators (rrs) are widely used to control bacterial responses to environmental challenges. <s1> some bacteria have over 150 different two-component pathways, and the specificity of the phosphotransfer reactions within these systems is tightly controlled to prevent unwanted crosstalk. <s2> one of the best understood two-component signalling pathways is the chemotaxis pathway. <s3> here, we present the 1.40 a crystal structure of the histidine-containing phosphotransfer domain of the chemotaxis hpk, chea(3), in complex with its cognate rr, chey(6). <s4> a methionine finger on chey(6) that nestles in a hydrophobic pocket in chea(3) was shown to be important for the interaction and was found to only occur in the cognate rrs of chea(3), chey(6), and cheb(2). <s5> site-directed mutagenesis of this methionine in combination with two adjacent residues abolished binding, as shown by surface plasmon resonance studies, and phosphotransfer from chea(3)-p to chey(6). <s6> introduction of this methionine and an adjacent alanine residue into a range of noncognate cheys, dramatically changed their specificity, allowing protein interaction and rapid phosphotransfer from chea(3)-p. the structure presented here has allowed us to identify specificity determinants for the chea-chey interaction and subsequently to successfully reengineer phosphotransfer signalling. <s7> in summary, our results provide valuable insight into how cells mediate specificity in one of the most abundant signalling pathways in biology, two-component signal transduction.

lp+ss: Rapid phosphotransfer rates are correlated with histidine kinase regulator specificity. <s0> autophagy is the primary catabolic process triggered in response to starvation. <s1> although autophagic regulation within the cytosolic compartment is well established, it is becoming clear that nuclear events also regulate the induction or repression of autophagy. <s2> nevertheless, a thorough understanding of the mechanisms by which sequence-specific transcription factors modulate expression of genes required for autophagy is lacking. <s3> here, we identify foxk proteins (foxk1 and foxk2) as transcriptional repressors of autophagy in muscle cells and fibroblasts. <s4> interestingly, foxk1/2 serve to counter-balance another forkhead transcription factor, foxo3, which induces an overlapping set of autophagic and atrophic targets in muscle. <s5> foxk1/2 specifically recruits sin3a-hdac complexes to restrict acetylation of histone h4 and expression of critical autophagy genes. <s6> remarkably, mtor promotes the transcriptional activity of foxk1 by facilitating nuclear entry to specifically limit basal levels of autophagy in nutrient-rich conditions. <s7> our study highlights an ancient, conserved mechanism whereby nutritional status is interpreted by mtor to restrict autophagy by repressing essential autophagy genes through foxk-sin3-mediated transcriptional control.

lp+ss: Reduced levels of lipolysis leads to higher P38 phosphorylation in adipose tissue. <s0> cigarette smoking promotes body weight reduction in humans while paradoxically also promoting insulin resistance (ir) and hyperinsulinemia. <s1> however, the mechanisms behind these effects are unclear. <s2> here we show that nicotine, a major constituent of cigarette smoke, selectively activates amp-activated protein kinase α2 (ampkα2) in adipocytes, which in turn phosphorylates map kinase phosphatase-1 (mkp1) at serine 334, initiating its proteasome-dependent degradation. <s3> the nicotine-dependent reduction of mkp1 induces the aberrant activation of both p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-jun n-terminal kinase, leading to increased phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (irs1) at serine 307. <s4> phosphorylation of irs1 leads to its degradation, protein kinase b inhibition, and the loss of insulin-mediated inhibition of lipolysis. <s5> consequently, nicotine increases lipolysis, which results in body weight reduction, but this increase also elevates the levels of circulating free fatty acids and thus causes ir in insulin-sensitive tissues. <s6> these results establish ampkα2 as an essential mediator of nicotine-induced whole-body ir in spite of reductions in adiposity.

lp+ss: Reduced phosphorylation of PP2A suppresses HDAC4 dephosphorylation. <s0> serotonin signaling suppresses generation of amyloid-β (aβ) in vitro and in animal models of alzheimer's disease (ad). <s1> we show that in an aged transgenic ad mouse model (app/ps1 plaque-bearing mice), the antidepressant citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, decreased aβ in brain interstitial fluid in a dose-dependent manner. <s2> growth of individual amyloid plaques was assessed in plaque-bearing mice that were chronically administered citalopram. <s3> citalopram arrested the growth of preexisting plaques and reduced the appearance of new plaques by 78%. <s4> in healthy human volunteers, citalopram's effects on aβ production and aβ concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) were measured prospectively using stable isotope labeling kinetics, with csf sampling during acute dosing of citalopram. <s5> aβ production in csf was slowed by 37% in the citalopram group compared to placebo. <s6> this change was associated with a 38% decrease in total csf aβ concentrations in the drug-treated group. <s7> the ability to safely decrease aβ concentrations is potentially important as a preventive strategy for ad. <s8> this study demonstrates key target engagement for future ad prevention trials. 
lp+ss: Reduced responsiveness to interleukin-2 in regulatory T cells is associated with autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 Diabetes. <s0> autoimmune diseases are thought to result from imbalances in normal immune physiology and regulation. <s1> here, we show that autoimmune disease susceptibility and resistance alleles on mouse chromosome 3 (idd3) correlate with differential expression of the key immunoregulatory cytokine interleukin-2 (il-2). <s2> in order to test directly that an approximately twofold reduction in il-2 underpins the idd3-linked destabilization of immune homeostasis, we show that engineered haplodeficiency of il2 gene expression not only reduces t cell il-2 production by twofold but also mimics the autoimmune dysregulatory effects of the naturally occurring susceptibility alleles of il2. <s3> reduced il-2 production achieved by either genetic mechanism correlates with reduced function of cd4+ cd25+ regulatory t cells, which are critical for maintaining immune homeostasis.

lp+ss: Reduced responsiveness to interleukin-2 in regulatory T cells is associated with autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 Diabetes. <s0> numerous reports have demonstrated that cd4(+)cd25(+) regulatory t cells (tregs) from individuals with a range of human autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes, are deficient in their ability to control autologous proinflammatory responses when compared with nondiseased, control individuals. <s1> treg dysfunction could be a primary, causal event or may result from perturbations in the immune system during disease development. <s2> polymorphisms in genes associated with treg function, such as il2ra, confer a higher risk of autoimmune disease. <s3> although this suggests a primary role for defective tregs in autoimmunity, a link between il2ra gene polymorphisms and treg function has not been examined. <s4> we addressed this by examining the impact of an il2ra haplotype associated with type 1 diabetes on treg fitness and suppressive function. <s5> studies were conducted using healthy human subjects to avoid any confounding effects of disease. <s6> we demonstrated that the presence of an autoimmune disease-associated il2ra haplotype correlates with diminished il-2 responsiveness in ag-experienced cd4(+) t cells, as measured by phosphorylation of stat5a, and is associated with lower levels of foxp3 expression by tregs and a reduction in their ability to suppress proliferation of autologous effector t cells. <s7> these data offer a rationale that contributes to the molecular and cellular mechanisms through which polymorphisms in the il-2ra gene affect immune regulation, and consequently upon susceptibility to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

lp+ss: Reduced responsiveness to interleukin-2 in regulatory T cells is associated with autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 Diabetes. <s0> the yap transcription coactivator has been implicated as an oncogene and is amplified in human cancers. <s1> recent studies have established that yap is phosphorylated and inhibited by the hippo tumor suppressor pathway. <s2> here we demonstrate that the tead family transcription factors are essential in mediating yap-dependent gene expression. <s3> tead is also required for yap-induced cell growth, oncogenic transformation, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. <s4> ctgf is identified as a direct yap target gene important for cell growth. <s5> moreover, the functional relationship between yap and tead is conserved in drosophila yki (the yap homolog) and scalloped (the tead homolog). <s6> our study reveals tead as a new component in the hippo pathway playing essential roles in mediating biological functions of yap. 
lp+ss: Reducing H3k4me3 methylation induces mouse epiblast stem cells to naive pluripotency efficiently. <s0> the interconversion between naive and primed pluripotent states is accompanied by drastic epigenetic rearrangements. <s1> however, it is unclear whether intrinsic epigenetic events can drive reprogramming to naive pluripotency or if distinct chromatin states are instead simply a reflection of discrete pluripotent states. <s2> here, we show that blocking histone h3k4 methyltransferase mll1 activity with the small-molecule inhibitor mm-401 reprograms mouse epiblast stem cells (episcs) to naive pluripotency. <s3> this reversion is highly efficient and synchronized, with more than 50% of treated episcs exhibiting features of naive embryonic stem cells (escs) within 3 days. <s4> reverted escs reactivate the silenced x chromosome and contribute to embryos following blastocyst injection, generating germline-competent chimeras. <s5> importantly, blocking mll1 leads to global redistribution of h3k4me1 at enhancers and represses lineage determinant factors and episc markers, which indirectly regulate esc transcription circuitry. <s6> these findings show that discrete perturbation of h3k4 methylation is sufficient to drive reprogramming to naive pluripotency.

lp+ss: Reducing H3k4me3 methylation induces mouse epiblast stem cells to naive pluripotency efficiently. <s0> autophagy is the principal catabolic response to nutrient starvation and is necessary to clear dysfunctional or damaged organelles, but excessive autophagy can be cytotoxic or cytostatic and contributes to cell death. <s1> depending on the abundance of enzymes involved in molecule biosynthesis, cells can be dependent on uptake of exogenous nutrients to provide these molecules. <s2> argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ass1) is a key enzyme in arginine biosynthesis, and its abundance is reduced in many solid tumors, making them sensitive to external arginine depletion. <s3> we demonstrated that prolonged arginine starvation by exposure to adi-peg20 (pegylated arginine deiminase) induced autophagy-dependent death of ass1-deficient breast cancer cells, because these cells are arginine auxotrophs (dependent on uptake of extracellular arginine). <s4> indeed, these breast cancer cells died in culture when exposed to adi-peg20 or cultured in the absence of arginine. <s5> arginine starvation induced mitochondrial oxidative stress, which impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics and integrity. <s6> furthermore, arginine starvation killed breast cancer cells in vivo and in vitro only if they were autophagy-competent. <s7> thus, a key mechanism underlying the lethality induced by prolonged arginine starvation was the cytotoxic autophagy that occurred in response to mitochondrial damage. <s8> last, ass1 was either low in abundance or absent in more than 60% of 149 random breast cancer biosamples, suggesting that patients with such tumors could be candidates for arginine starvation therapy.

lp+ss: Repressing IL-18 has negative effects on atherosclerotic lesion composition and progression. <s0> although evaluation of the treatment of congestive heart failure is usually based on objective clinical outcomes, patient self-assessment is increasingly recognized as an important component of evaluation. <s1> a study was designed to measure the quality of life of 134 patients with symptoms of advanced heart failure who were being evaluated for possible heart transplantation. <s2> the patients' quality of life was assessed using a mix of subjective and objective measures, including functional status, physical symptoms, emotional state, and psychosocial adaptation. <s3> there was no significant relationship between patients' cardiac ejection fraction and any quality-of-life measures; however, the results of a 6-minute walking test, new york heart association classification, and self-reported functional status were all significantly correlated with psychosocial adjustment. <s4> self-reported functional status, depression, and hostility accounted for 43% of the variance in total psychosocial adjustment to illness. <s5> these findings support the inclusion of quality of life as an outcome measure in any evaluation of treatment efficacy and suggest that interventions to improve the quality of life of patients with advanced heart failure need to be targeted at reducing depression and hostility and increasing daily activity levels. 
lp+ss: Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma (RORγ) is a therapeutic target for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) <s0> the androgen receptor (ar) is overexpressed and hyperactivated in human castration-resistant prostate cancer (crpc). <s1> however, the determinants of ar overexpression in crpc are poorly defined. <s2> here we show that retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor γ (ror-γ) is overexpressed and amplified in metastatic crpc tumors, and that ror-γ drives ar expression in the tumors. <s3> ror-γ recruits nuclear receptor coactivator 1 and 3 (ncoa1 and ncoa3, also known as src-1 and src-3) to an ar-ror response element (rore) to stimulate ar gene transcription. <s4> ror-γ antagonists suppress the expression of both ar and its variant ar-v7 in prostate cancer (pca) cell lines and tumors. <s5> ror-γ antagonists also markedly diminish genome-wide ar binding, h3k27ac abundance and expression of the ar target gene network. <s6> finally, ror-γ antagonists suppressed tumor growth in multiple ar-expressing, but not ar-negative, xenograft pca models, and they effectively sensitized crpc tumors to enzalutamide, without overt toxicity, in mice. <s7> taken together, these results establish ror-γ as a key player in crpc by acting upstream of ar and as a potential therapeutic target for advanced pca.

lp+ss: Rhythmic expression of Cry1 translates directly into a circadian regulation of cAMP signaling in hepatic glucose metabolism. <s0> bcl-6, a transcriptional repressor frequently translocated in lymphomas, regulates germinal center b cell differentiation and inflammation. <s1> dna microarray screening identified genes repressed by bcl-6, including many lymphocyte activation genes, suggesting that bcl-6 modulates b cell receptor signals. <s2> bcl-6 repression of two chemokine genes, mip-1alpha and ip-10, may also attenuate inflammatory responses. <s3> blimp-1, another bcl-6 target, is important for plasmacytic differentiation. <s4> since bcl-6 expression is silenced in plasma cells, repression of blimp-1 by bcl-6 may control plasmacytic differentiation. <s5> indeed, inhibition of bcl-6 function initiated changes indicative of plasmacytic differentiation, including decreased expression of c-myc and increased expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27kip1. <s6> these data suggest that malignant transformation by bcl-6 involves inhibition of differentiation and enhanced proliferation. 
lp+ss: Ribosomal protein (RP) expression is controlled in part by stress-activated regulators. <s0> healthy cells utilize intricate systems to monitor their environment and mount robust responses in the event of cellular stress. <s1> whether stress arises from external insults or defects due to mutation and disease, cells must be able to respond precisely to mount the appropriate defenses. <s2> multi-faceted stress responses are generally coupled with arrest of growth and cell-cycle progression, which both limits the transmission of damaged materials and serves to reallocate limited cellular resources toward defense. <s3> therefore, stress defense versus rapid growth represent competing interests in the cell. <s4> how eukaryotic cells set the balance between defense versus proliferation, and in particular knowledge of the regulatory networks that control this decision, are poorly understood. <s5> in this perspective, we expand upon our recent work inferring the stress-activated signaling network in budding yeast, which captures pathways controlling stress defense and regulators of growth and cell-cycle progression. <s6> we highlight similarities between the yeast and mammalian stress responses and explore how stress-activated signaling networks in yeast can inform on signaling defects in human cancers.

lp+ss: Risedronate increases risk of vertebral and non-vertebral fractures. <s0> the mammalian a-type cyclin family consists of two members, cyclin a1 (encoded by ccna1) and cyclin a2 (encoded by ccna2). <s1> cyclin a2 promotes both g1/s and g2/m transitions, and targeted deletion of ccna2 in mouse is embryonic lethal. <s2> cyclin a1 is expressed in mice exclusively in the germ cell lineage and is expressed in humans at highest levels in the testis and certain myeloid leukaemia cells. <s3> to investigate the role of cyclin a1 and possible redundancy among the cyclins in vivo, we generated mice bearing a null mutation of ccna1. <s4> ccna1-/- males were sterile due to a block of spermatogenesis before the first meiotic division, whereas females were normal. <s5> meiosis arrest in ccna1–/– males was associated with increased germ cell apoptosis, desynapsis abnormalities and reduction of cdc2 kinase activation at the end of meiotic prophase. <s6> cyclin a1 is therefore essential for spermatocyte passage into the first meiotic division in male mice, a function that cannot be complemented by the concurrently expressed b-type cyclins. 
lp+ss: Risk of cardiovascular events can be cut by a third by using antihypertensive drug therapy among hemodialysis patients. <s0> epidemiological studies demonstrate that a lower blood pressure and decline in blood pressure over months or years are associated with higher mortality in dialysis patients. <s1> in contrast, randomized, controlled trials lack power to establish benefits of antihypertensive therapy. <s2> patients on long-term dialysis participating in randomized, controlled trials and receiving antihypertensive drug therapy were the subject of this meta-analysis. <s3> outcomes assessed were the hazard ratio of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality in treated group compared with controls. <s4> among 1202 patients who we identified in 5 studies, the overall benefit of antihypertensive therapy compared with the control or placebo group had a combined hazard ratio for cardiovascular events of 0.69 (95% ci: 0.56 to 0.84) using a fixed-effects model and 0.62 (95% ci: 0.45 to 0.86) using a random-effects model. <s5> in a sensitivity analysis, we found that the hypertensive group had a pooled hazard ratio of 0.49 (95% ci: 0.35 to 0.67), but when normotensives were included in the trial, lesser cardiovascular protection was seen (pooled hazard ratio of 0.86 [95% ci: 0.67 to 1.12]). <s6> test for heterogeneity between hypertensive and "normotensive-included" groups was significant (p<0.006). <s7> similar results were seen for risk ratio for death and cardiovascular events. <s8> there was evidence of publication bias based on egger's test and funnel plot. <s9> randomized trials suggested a benefit of antihypertensive therapy among hemodialysis patients. <s10> adequately powered randomized trials are required to confirm these observations, especially among those with hypertension.

lp+ss: Risk-adjusted mortality rates are similar in teaching and non-teaching hospitals. <s0> background  extensive debate exists in the healthcare community over whether outcomes of medical care at teaching hospitals and other healthcare units are better or worse than those at the respective nonteaching ones. <s1> thus, our goal was to systematically evaluate the evidence pertaining to this question.    <s2> methods and findings  we reviewed all studies that compared teaching versus nonteaching healthcare structures for mortality or any other patient outcome, regardless of health condition. <s3> studies were retrieved from pubmed, contact with experts, and literature cross-referencing. <s4> data were extracted on setting, patients, data sources, author affiliations, definition of compared groups, types of diagnoses considered, adjusting covariates, and estimates of effect for mortality and for each other outcome. <s5> overall, 132 eligible studies were identified, including 93 on mortality and 61 on other eligible outcomes (22 addressed both). <s6> synthesis of the available adjusted estimates on mortality yielded a summary relative risk of 0.96 (95% confidence interval [ci], 0.93–1.00) for teaching versus nonteaching healthcare structures and 1.04 (95% ci, 0.99–1.10) for minor teaching versus nonteaching ones. <s7> there was considerable heterogeneity between studies (i2 = 72% for the main analysis). <s8> results were similar in studies using clinical and those using administrative databases. <s9> no differences were seen in the 14 studies fully adjusting for volume/experience, severity, and comorbidity (relative risk 1.01). <s10> smaller studies did not differ in their results from larger studies. <s11> differences were seen for some diagnoses (e.g., significantly better survival for breast cancer and cerebrovascular accidents in teaching hospitals and significantly better survival from cholecystectomy in nonteaching hospitals), but these were small in magnitude. <s12> other outcomes were diverse, but typically teaching healthcare structures did not do better than nonteaching ones.    <s13> conclusions  the available data are limited by their nonrandomized design, but overall they do not suggest that a healthcare facility's teaching status on its own markedly improves or worsens patient outcomes. <s14> differences for specific diseases cannot be excluded, but are likely to be small.

lp+ss: Risk-adjusted mortality rates are similar in teaching and non-teaching hospitals. <s0> acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all) is an aggressive hematological tumor resulting from the malignant transformation of lymphoid progenitors. <s1> despite intensive chemotherapy, 20% of pediatric patients and over 50% of adult patients with all do not achieve a complete remission or relapse after intensified chemotherapy, making disease relapse and resistance to therapy the most substantial challenge in the treatment of this disease. <s2> using whole-exome sequencing, we identify mutations in the cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase ii gene (nt5c2), which encodes a 5'-nucleotidase enzyme that is responsible for the inactivation of nucleoside-analog chemotherapy drugs, in 20/103 (19%) relapse t cell alls and 1/35 (3%) relapse b-precursor alls. <s3> nt5c2 mutant proteins show increased nucleotidase activity in vitro and conferred resistance to chemotherapy with 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine when expressed in all lymphoblasts. <s4> these results support a prominent role for activating mutations in nt5c2 and increased nucleoside-analog metabolism in disease progression and chemotherapy resistance in all. 
lp+ss: Risk-adjusted mortality rates are similar in teaching and non-teaching hospitals. <s0> this study aimed to compare the symptoms, unmet needs, and qol reported by women at 6 months to <2 years and 2 to 5 years following surgery and adjuvant treatment for breast cancer. <s1> it also evaluated the relationships among symptoms, unmet needs, and qol using structural equation modeling. <s2> in this study, 113 and 137 survivors following breast cancer treatment 6 months to <2 years and 2 to 5 years, respectively, completed the memorial symptom assessment scale, the supportive care needs survey-34, and the medical outcomes study 12-item short form health survey version 2.0 during their medical follow-up. <s3> the mean numbers of symptoms and unmet needs were 5.43 and 3.0, respectively, for survivors at <2 years, and 5.24 and 2.42, respectively, for survivors at 2 to 5 years following treatment. <s4> the most common reported symptoms were related primarily to physical domains. <s5> no significant differences were found between the two survivor groups on the msas scores. <s6> survivors at <2 years reported significantly higher scores in psychological and health care system/information needs (p < 0.01), and lower composite scores in physical and mental qol (p < 0.05) than those at 2 to 5 years post-treatment. <s7> significant direct and indirect effects were found of symptom burden through unmet needs on survivors' physical and mental qol after adjustment for survival time, and the models showed a good fit. <s8> results suggest that breast cancer survivors continue to endure many symptoms independent of the survivorship period. <s9> the unmet needs mediate the relationship between symptom burden and survivors' qol. 
lp+ss: Rotator cuff exercises are more effective than general exercise therapy in reducing pain and improving function of the shoulder. <s0> objective to evaluate if a specific exercise strategy, targeting the rotator cuff and scapula stabilisers, improves shoulder function and pain more than unspecific exercises in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome, thereby decreasing the need for arthroscopic subacromial decompression.  <s1> design randomised, participant and single assessor blinded, controlled study.  <s2> setting department of orthopaedics in a swedish university hospital.  <s3> participants 102 patients with long standing (over six months) persistent subacromial impingement syndrome in whom earlier conservative treatment had failed, recruited through orthopaedic specialists.  <s4> interventions the specific exercise strategy consisted of strengthening eccentric exercises for the rotator cuff and concentric/eccentric exercises for the scapula stabilisers in combination with manual mobilisation. <s5> the control exercise programme consisted of unspecific movement exercises for the neck and shoulder. <s6> patients in both groups received five to six individual guided treatment sessions during 12 weeks. <s7> in between these supervised sessions the participants performed home exercises once or twice a day for 12 weeks.  <s8> main outcome measures the primary outcome was the constant-murley shoulder assessment score evaluating shoulder function and pain. <s9> secondary outcomes were patients' global impression of change because of treatment and decision regarding surgery.  <s10> results most (97, 95%) participants completed the 12 week study. <s11> there was a significantly greater improvement in the constant-murley score in the specific exercise group than in the control exercise group (24 points (95% confidence interval 19 to 28.0) v 9 points (5 to 13); mean difference between group: 15 points (8.5 to 20.6)). <s12> significantly more patients in the specific exercise group reported successful outcome (defined as large improvement or recovered) in the patients' global assessment of change because of treatment: 69% (35/51) v 24% (11/46); odds ratio 7.6, 3.1 to 18.9; p<0.001. <s13> a significantly lower proportion of patients in the specific exercise group subsequently chose to undergo surgery: 20% (10/51) v 63% (29/46); odds ratio 7.7, 3.1 to 19.4; p<0.001).  <s14> conclusion a specific exercise strategy, focusing on strengthening eccentric exercises for the rotator cuff and concentric/eccentric exercises for the scapula stabilisers, is effective in reducing pain and improving shoulder function in patients with persistent subacromial impingement syndrome. <s15> by extension, this exercise strategy reduces the need for arthroscopic subacromial decompression within the three month timeframe used in the study.  <s16> trial registration clinical trials nct01037673.

lp+ss: Roughly 55% of women with chronic pelvic pain have no underlying pathology. <s0> epigallocatechin-3-gallate (egcg), a polyphenol extracted from green tea, is an antioxidant with chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic actions. <s1> based on its ability to modulate growth factor-mediated cell proliferation, we evaluated its efficacy in multiple myeloma (mm). <s2> egcg induced both dose- and time-dependent growth arrest and subsequent apoptotic cell death in mm cell lines including il-6-dependent cells and primary patient cells, without significant effect on the growth of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) and normal fibroblasts. <s3> treatment with egcg also led to significant apoptosis in human myeloma cells grown as tumors in scid mice. <s4> egcg interacts with the 67-kda laminin receptor 1 (lr1), which is significantly elevated in myeloma cell lines and patient samples relative to normal pbmcs. <s5> rnai-mediated inhibition of lr1 resulted in abrogation of egcg-induced apoptosis in myeloma cells, indicating that lr1 plays an important role in mediating egcg activity in mm while sparing pbmcs. <s6> evaluation of changes in gene expression profile indicates that egcg treatment activates distinct pathways of growth arrest and apoptosis in mm cells by inducing the expression of death-associated protein kinase 2, the initiators and mediators of death receptor-dependent apoptosis (fas ligand, fas, and caspase 4), p53-like proteins (p73, p63), positive regulators of apoptosis and nf-kappab activation (card10, card14), and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (p16 and p18). <s7> expression of related genes at the protein level were also confirmed by western blot analysis. <s8> these data demonstrate potent and specific antimyeloma activity of egcg and provide the rationale for its clinical evaluation. 
lp+ss: Roughly 55% of women with chronic pelvic pain have no underlying pathology. <s0> object awake craniotomy was performed as the standard surgical approach to supratentorial intraaxial tumors, regardless of the involvement of eloquent cortex, in a prospective trial of 200 patients surgically treated by the same surgeon at a single institution.  <s1> methods patient presentations, comorbid conditions, tumor locations, and the histological characteristics of lesions were recorded. <s2> brain mapping was possible in 195 (97.5%) of 200 patients. <s3> the total number of patients sustaining complications was 33 for an overall complication rate of 16.5%. <s4> there were two deaths in this series, for a mortality rate of 1%. <s5> new postoperative neurological deficits were seen in 13% of the patients, but these were permanent in only 4.5% of them. <s6> complication rates were higher in patients who had gliomas or preoperative neurological deficits and in those who had undergone prior radiation therapy or surgery. <s7> no patient who entered the operating room neurologically intact sustained a permanent neurological deficit postoperatively. <s8> of the most recent 50 patients treated, three (6%) required a stay in the intensive care unit, and the median total hospital stay was 1 day.  <s9> conclusions use of awake craniotomy can result in a considerable reduction in resource utilization without compromising patient care by minimizing intensive care time and total hospital stay. <s10> awake craniotomy is a practical and effective standard surgical approach to supratentorial tumors with a low complication rate, and provides an excellent alternative to craniotomy performed with the patient in the state of general anesthesia because it allows the opportunity for brain mapping and avoids general anesthesia. 
lp+ss: Satellite cell dysfunction is a key factor in sarcopenia development. <s0> a key determinant of geriatric frailty is sarcopenia, the age-associated loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength. <s1> although the etiology of sarcopenia is unknown, the correlation during aging between the loss of activity of satellite cells, which are endogenous muscle stem cells, and impaired muscle regenerative capacity has led to the hypothesis that the loss of satellite cell activity is also a cause of sarcopenia. <s2> we tested this hypothesis in male sedentary mice by experimentally depleting satellite cells in young adult animals to a degree sufficient to impair regeneration throughout the rest of their lives. <s3> a detailed analysis of multiple muscles harvested at various time points during aging in different cohorts of these mice showed that the muscles were of normal size, despite low regenerative capacity, but did have increased fibrosis. <s4> these results suggest that lifelong reduction of satellite cells neither accelerated nor exacerbated sarcopenia and that satellite cells did not contribute to the maintenance of muscle size or fiber type composition during aging, but that their loss may contribute to age-related muscle fibrosis.

lp+ss: ScPif1p has higher binding ability to G-rich ssDNA than to non-G-rich ssDNA. <s0> over the last decades, mesenchymal stromal cells (msc) have been the focus of intense research by academia and industry due to their unique features. <s1> msc can be easily isolated and expanded through in vitro culture by taking full advantage of their self-renewing capacity. <s2> in addition, msc exert immunomodulatory effects and can be differentiated into various lineages, which makes them highly attractive for clinical applications in cell-based therapies. <s3> in this review, we attempt to provide a brief historical overview of msc discovery, characterization, and the first clinical studies conducted. <s4> the current msc manufacturing platforms are reviewed with special attention regarding the use of bioreactors for the production of gmp-compliant clinically relevant cell numbers. <s5> the first commercial msc-based products are also addressed, as well as the remaining challenges to the widespread use of msc-derived products. 
lp+ss: ScPif1p has higher binding ability to G-rich ssDNA than to non-G-rich ssDNA. <s0> the saccharomyces cerevisiae pif1 helicase is the prototypical member of the pif1 dna helicase family, which is conserved from bacteria to humans. <s1> here we show that exceptionally potent g-quadruplex unwinding is conserved among pif1 helicases. <s2> moreover, pif1 helicases from organisms separated by more than 3 billion years of evolution suppressed dna damage at g-quadruplex motifs in yeast. <s3> the g-quadruplex-induced damage generated in the absence of pif1 helicases led to new genetic and epigenetic changes. <s4> furthermore, when expressed in yeast, human pif1 suppressed both g-quadruplex-associated dna damage and telomere lengthening. 
lp+ss: ScPif1p has reduced binding ability to G-rich ssDNA compared to non-G-rich ssDNA. <s0> our attitude towards candy—"if it tastes that good, it can't be healthy"—betrays society's puritanical stance towards pleasure. <s1> candy has been blamed for various ills, including hyperactivity in children; however, clinical trials have not supported this.1  candy—sugar confectionery and chocolate—is not a recent invention: the ancient arabs, chinese, and egyptians candied fruits and nuts in honey, and the aztecs made a chocolate drink from the bean of the cacao tree. <s2> today, americans gratify themselves with, on average, 5.4 kg of sugar candy and 6.5 kg of chocolate per person annually.2  since candy has existed for centuries, we surmised that it cannot be totally unhealthy. <s3> we decided to investigate whether candy consumption was associated with longevity.   <s4> subjects were from the harvard alumni health study, an ongoing study of men entering harvard university as undergraduates between 1916 and 1950. <s5> we included 7841 men, free of cardiovascular disease and cancer, who responded to a health survey … 
lp+ss: ScPif1p has reduced binding ability to G-rich ssDNA compared to non-G-rich ssDNA. <s0> the concept of the neurovascular unit (nvu), formalized at the 2001 stroke progress review group meeting of the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke, emphasizes the intimate relationship between the brain and its vessels. <s1> since then, the nvu has attracted the interest of the neuroscience community, resulting in considerable advances in the field. <s2> here the current state of knowledge of the nvu will be assessed, focusing on one of its most vital roles: the coupling between neural activity and blood flow. <s3> the evidence supports a conceptual shift in the mechanisms of neurovascular coupling, from a unidimensional process involving neuronal-astrocytic signaling to local blood vessels to a multidimensional one in which mediators released from multiple cells engage distinct signaling pathways and effector systems across the entire cerebrovascular network in a highly orchestrated manner. <s4> the recently appreciated nvu dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases, although still poorly understood, supports emerging concepts that maintaining neurovascular health promotes brain health.

lp+ss: Self-advocacy training is effective at decreasing homelessness. <s0> the extensive computerisation of danish pharmacies has permitted the establishment of two large prescription registries: the odense university pharmacoepidemiological database (oped) and the pharmacoepidemiological prescription database of north jutland (pdnj). <s1> the danish prescription registries content, coverage, completeness and the quality of the data are discussed in this article. <s2> furthermore, conditions for access to the data are presented. <s3> the two prescription registries cover a background population of approximately one million or 18% of the danish population. <s4> the populations covered by the registries are stable and representative of the danish population in general. <s5> the registries cover all reimbursed medicine at the level of the individual user. <s6> registration of a unique and permanent personal identifier enables the compilation of longitudinal drug histories and allows the linking of prescription data to other population-based danish registries. <s7> the degree of completeness of the danish prescription registries is excellent for reimbursed prescription drugs. <s8> a small number of comparison studies also indicate high validity of the register information. <s9> the danish prescription registries represent a useful new data source for pharmacoepidemiological studies.

lp+ss: Sepsis related mortality has remained stable between 2009-2014. <s0> objective: to provide an update to "surviving sepsis campaign guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock: 2012. <s1> " design: a consensus committee of 55 international experts representing 25 international organizations was convened. <s2> nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). <s3> a formal conflict-of-interest (coi) policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. <s4> a stand-alone meeting was held for all panel members in december 2015. <s5> teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development. <s6> methods: the panel consisted of five sections: hemodynamics, infection, adjunctive therapies, metabolic, and ventilation. <s7> population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes (pico) questions were reviewed and updated as needed, and evidence profiles were generated. <s8> each subgroup generated a list of questions, searched for best available evidence, and then followed the principles of the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (grade) system to assess the quality of evidence from high to very low, and to formulate recommendations as strong or weak, or best practice statement when applicable. <s9> results: the surviving sepsis guideline panel provided 93 statements on early management and resuscitation of patients with sepsis or septic shock. <s10> overall, 32 were strong recommendations, 39 were weak recommendations, and 18 were best-practice statements. <s11> no recommendation was provided for four questions. <s12> conclusions: substantial agreement exists among a large cohort of international experts regarding many strong recommendations for the best care of patients with sepsis. <s13> although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for these critically ill patients with high mortality.

lp+ss: Sepsis related mortality has risen from 2009 to 2014. <s0> objectives to develop and validate updated qrisk3 prediction algorithms to estimate the 10 year risk of cardiovascular disease in women and men accounting for potential new risk factors. <s1> design prospective open cohort study. <s2> setting general practices in england providing data for the qresearch database. <s3> participants 1309 qresearch general practices in england: 981 practices were used to develop the scores and a separate set of 328 practices were used to validate the scores. <s4> 7.89 million patients aged 25-84 years were in the derivation cohort and 2.67 million patients in the validation cohort. <s5> patients were free of cardiovascular disease and not prescribed statins at baseline. <s6> methods cox proportional hazards models in the derivation cohort to derive separate risk equations in men and women for evaluation at 10 years. <s7> risk factors considered included those already in qrisk2 (age, ethnicity, deprivation, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, total cholesterol: high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, smoking, family history of coronary heart disease in a first degree relative aged less than 60 years, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, treated hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease (stage 4 or 5)) and new risk factors (chronic kidney disease (stage 3, 4, or 5), a measure of systolic blood pressure variability (standard deviation of repeated measures), migraine, corticosteroids, systemic lupus erythematosus (sle), atypical antipsychotics, severe mental illness, and hiv/aids). <s8> we also considered erectile dysfunction diagnosis or treatment in men. <s9> measures of calibration and discrimination were determined in the validation cohort for men and women separately and for individual subgroups by age group, ethnicity, and baseline disease status. <s10> main outcome measures incident cardiovascular disease recorded on any of the following three linked data sources: general practice, mortality, or hospital admission records. <s11> results 363 565 incident cases of cardiovascular disease were identified in the derivation cohort during follow-up arising from 50.8 million person years of observation. <s12> all new risk factors considered met the model inclusion criteria except for hiv/aids, which was not statistically significant. <s13> the models had good calibration and high levels of explained variation and discrimination. <s14> in women, the algorithm explained 59.6% of the variation in time to diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (r2, with higher values indicating more variation), and the d statistic was 2.48 and harrell's c statistic was 0.88 (both measures of discrimination, with higher values indicating better discrimination). <s15> the corresponding values for men were 54.8%, 2.26, and 0.86. <s16> overall performance of the updated qrisk3 algorithms was similar to the qrisk2 algorithms. <s17> conclusion updated qrisk3 risk prediction models were developed and validated. <s18> the inclusion of additional clinical variables in qrisk3 (chronic kidney disease, a measure of systolic blood pressure variability (standard deviation of repeated measures), migraine, corticosteroids, sle, atypical antipsychotics, severe mental illness, and erectile dysfunction) can help enable doctors to identify those at most risk of heart disease and stroke. 
lp+ss: Sequence conservation in gene regulatory regions between species is a high-accuracy predictor of conserved functionality. <s0> context blood type and crossmatch incompatibility will exclude at least one third of patients in need from receiving a live donor kidney transplant. <s1> kidney paired donation (kpd) offers incompatible donor/recipient pairs the opportunity to match for compatible transplants. <s2> despite its increasing popularity, very few transplants have resulted from kpd.  <s3> objective to determine the potential impact of improved matching schemes on the number and quality of transplants achievable with kpd.  <s4> design, setting, and population we developed a model that simulates pools of incompatible donor/recipient pairs. <s5> we designed a mathematically verifiable optimized matching algorithm and compared it with the scheme currently used in some centers and regions. <s6> simulated patients from the general community with characteristics drawn from distributions describing end-stage renal disease patients eligible for renal transplantation and their willing and eligible live donors.  <s7> main outcome measures number of kidneys matched, hla mismatch of matched kidneys, and number of grafts surviving 5 years after transplantation.  <s8> results a national optimized matching algorithm would result in more transplants (47.7% vs 42.0%, p<.001), better hla concordance (3.0 vs 4.5 mismatched antigens; p<.001), more grafts surviving at 5 years (34.9% vs 28.7%; p<.001), and a reduction in the number of pairs required to travel (2.9% vs 18.4%; p<.001) when compared with an extension of the currently used first-accept scheme to a national level. <s9> furthermore, highly sensitized patients would benefit 6-fold from a national optimized scheme (2.3% vs 14.1% successfully matched; p<.001). <s10> even if only 7% of patients awaiting kidney transplantation participated in an optimized national kpd program, the health care system could save as much as $750 million.  <s11> conclusions the combination of a national kpd program and a mathematically optimized matching algorithm yields more matches with lower hla disparity. <s12> optimized matching affords patients the flexibility of customizing their matching priorities and the security of knowing that the greatest number of high-quality matches will be found and distributed equitably.

lp+ss: Side effects associated with antidepressants increases risk of stroke. <s0> wild-type p53 has recently been shown to repress transcription from several cellular and viral promoters. <s1> since p53 mutations are the most frequently reported genetic defects in human cancers, it becomes important to study the effects of mutations of p53 on promoter functions. <s2> we, therefore, have studied the effects of wild-type and mutant human p53 on the human proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (pcna) promoter and on several viral promoters, including the herpes simplex virus type 1 ul9 promoter, the human cytomegalovirus major immediate-early promoter-enhancer, and the long terminal repeat promoters of rous sarcoma virus and human t-cell lymphotropic virus type i. hela cells were cotransfected with a wild-type or mutant p53 expression vector and a plasmid containing a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene under viral (or cellular) promoter control. <s3> as expected, expression of the wild-type p53 inhibited promoter function. <s4> expression of a p53 with a mutation at any one of the four amino acid positions 175, 248, 273, or 281, however, correlated with a significant increase of the pcna promoter activity (2- to 11-fold). <s5> the viral promoters were also activated, although to a somewhat lesser extent. <s6> we also showed that activation by a mutant p53 requires a minimal promoter containing a lone tata box. <s7> a more significant increase (25-fold) in activation occurs when the promoter contains a binding site for the activating transcription factor or cyclic amp response element-binding protein. <s8> using saos-2 cells that do not express p53, we showed that activation by a mutant p53 was a direct enhancement. <s9> the mutant forms of p53 used in this study are found in various cancer cells. <s10> the activation of pcna by mutant p53s may indicate a way to increase cell proliferation by the mutant p53s. <s11> thus, our data indicate a possible functional role for the mutants of p53 found in cancer cells in activating several important loci, including pcna. 
lp+ss: Side effects associated with antidepressants lower risk of myocardial infarction. <s0> background the use of bisphosphonates for the prevention of skeletal related events in women with bone metastases from breast cancer is well established. <s1> we undertook an evaluation of bisphosphonate use in clinical practice in three canadian cancer centres. <s2> in addition we assessed whether or not physicians at these centres are following their local treatment guidelines and funding policies.  <s3> methods charts and electronic files of patients who had received either clodronate or pamidronate at any time between january 2000 and december 2001 at three canadian cancer centres were retrospectively reviewed.  <s4> results there has been a marked improvement in the time between the diagnosis of bone metastases and the commencement of bisphosphonates from a median of 155 days in 1998 to 24 days in 2001. <s5> however, despite a local funding policy requiring that oral clodronate be the first bisphosphonate used, this was the case in only 67% of patients. <s6> in addition, despite one centre's guidelines recommending that bisphosphonates be stopped once the patient was progressing, 90% of their patients remained on bisphosphonates until they died.  <s7> conclusions a considerable amount of effort is spent on the creation of "evidence based" treatment guidelines. <s8> funding agencies develop policies based on these treatment guidelines, but often funding is more restrictive than the treatment guideline would suggest. <s9> it is clear from this review that physicians still appear to manage a substantial proportion of patients outside of funding policies, but within evidence based recommendations. <s10> therefore, a need exists for either the creation of guidelines and policies that physicians will follow or the implementation of methods to ensure that restrictive policies are actually followed.

lp+ss: Sn is present on mature DCs during inflammation in vivo. <s0> dendritic cells (dcs) are essential antigen-presenting cells for the induction of immunity against pathogens. <s1> however, hiv-1 spread is strongly enhanced in clusters of dcs and cd4(+) t cells. <s2> uninfected dcs capture hiv-1 and mediate viral transfer to bystander cd4(+) t cells through a process termed trans-infection. <s3> initial studies identified the c-type lectin dc-sign as the hiv-1 binding factor on dcs, which interacts with the viral envelope glycoproteins. <s4> upon dc maturation, however, dc-sign is down-regulated, while hiv-1 capture and trans-infection is strongly enhanced via a glycoprotein-independent capture pathway that recognizes sialyllactose-containing membrane gangliosides. <s5> here we show that the sialic acid-binding ig-like lectin 1 (siglec-1, cd169), which is highly expressed on mature dcs, specifically binds hiv-1 and vesicles carrying sialyllactose. <s6> furthermore, siglec-1 is essential for trans-infection by mature dcs. <s7> these findings identify siglec-1 as a key factor for hiv-1 spread via infectious dc/t-cell synapses, highlighting a novel mechanism that mediates hiv-1 dissemination in activated tissues.

lp+ss: Specialized functional cell types can be derived from human pluripotent stem cells. <s0> adam13 is a member of the disintegrin and metalloprotease protein family that is expressed on cranial neural crest cells surface and is essential for their migration. <s1> adam13 is an active protease that can cleave fibronectin in vitro and remodel a fibronectin substrate in vivo. <s2> using a recombinant secreted protein containing both disintegrin and cysteine-rich domains of adam13, we show that this "adhesive" region of the protein binds directly to fibronectin. <s3> fibronectin fusion proteins corresponding to the various functional domains were used to define the second heparin-binding domain as the adam13 binding site. <s4> mutation of the syndecan-binding site (pprr -> pptm) within this domain abolishes binding of the recombinant disintegrin and cysteine-rich domains of adam13. <s5> we further show that the adhesive disintegrin and cysteine-rich domain of adam13 can promote cell adhesion via beta(1) integrins. <s6> this adhesion requires integrin activation and can be prevented by antibodies to the cysteine-rich domain of adam13 and beta(1) integrin. <s7> finally, wild type, but not the e/a mutant of adam13 metalloprotease domain, can be shed from the cell surface, releasing the metalloprotease domain associated with the disintegrin and cysteine-rich domains. <s8> this suggests that adam13 shedding may involve its own metalloprotease activity and that the released protease may interact with both integrins and extracellular matrix proteins.

lp+ss: Specialized functional cell types can be derived from human pluripotent stem cells. <s0> background pluripotent embryonic stem (es) cells, which have the capacity to give rise to all tissue types in the body, show great promise as a versatile source of cells for regenerative therapy. <s1> however, the basic mechanisms of lineage specification of pluripotent stem cells are largely unknown, and generating sufficient quantities of desired cell types remains a formidable challenge. <s2> small molecules, particularly those that modulate key developmental pathways like the bone morphogenetic protein (bmp) signaling cascade, hold promise as tools to study in vitro lineage specification and to direct differentiation of stem cells toward particular cell types.  <s3> methodology/ principal findings we describe the use of dorsomorphin, a selective small molecule inhibitor of bmp signaling, to induce myocardial differentiation in mouse es cells. <s4> cardiac induction is very robust, increasing the yield of spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes by at least 20 fold. <s5> dorsomorphin, unlike the endogenous bmp antagonist noggin, robustly induces cardiomyogenesis when treatment is limited to the initial 24-hours of es cell differentiation. <s6> quantitative-pcr analyses of differentiating es cells indicate that pharmacological inhibition of bmp signaling during the early critical stage promotes the development of the cardiomyocyte lineage, but reduces the differentiation of endothelial, smooth muscle, and hematopoietic cells.  <s7> conclusions/ significance administration of a selective small molecule bmp inhibitor during the initial stages of es cell differentiation substantially promotes the differentiation of primitive pluripotent cells toward the cardiomyocytic lineage, apparently at the expense of other mesodermal lineages. <s8> small molecule modulators of developmental pathways like dorsomorphin could become versatile pharmacological tools for stem cell research and regenerative medicine.

lp+ss: Stacking is more stable when a purine is present in the +5 position (C1698). <s0> recognition of modified histones by 'reader' proteins plays a critical role in the regulation of chromatin. <s1> h3k36 trimethylation (h3k36me3) is deposited onto the nucleosomes in the transcribed regions after rna polymerase ii elongation. <s2> in yeast, this mark in turn recruits epigenetic regulators to reset the chromatin to a relatively repressive state, thus suppressing cryptic transcription. <s3> however, much less is known about the role of h3k36me3 in transcription regulation in mammals. <s4> this is further complicated by the transcription-coupled incorporation of the histone variant h3.3 in gene bodies. <s5> here we show that the candidate tumour suppressor zmynd11 specifically recognizes h3k36me3 on h3.3 (h3.3k36me3) and regulates rna polymerase ii elongation. <s6> structural studies show that in addition to the trimethyl-lysine binding by an aromatic cage within the pwwp domain, the h3.3-dependent recognition is mediated by the encapsulation of the h3.3-specific 'ser 31' residue in a composite pocket formed by the tandem bromo–pwwp domains of zmynd11. <s7> chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing shows a genome-wide co-localization of zmynd11 with h3k36me3 and h3.3 in gene bodies, and its occupancy requires the pre-deposition of h3.3k36me3. <s8> although zmynd11 is associated with highly expressed genes, it functions as an unconventional transcription co-repressor by modulating rna polymerase ii at the elongation stage. <s9> zmynd11 is critical for the repression of a transcriptional program that is essential for tumour cell growth; low expression levels of zmynd11 in breast cancer patients correlate with worse prognosis. <s10> consistently, overexpression of zmynd11 suppresses cancer cell growth in vitro and tumour formation in mice. <s11> together, this study identifies zmynd11 as an h3.3-specific reader of h3k36me3 that links the histone-variant-mediated transcription elongation control to tumour suppression.

lp+ss: Students who perform poorly in the early years of medical school are at increased risk for professional misconduct later in their careers. <s0> introduction the aim of this study was to examine health-related quality of life (hrqol) as measured by eq-5d and to investigate the influence of chronic conditions and other risk factors on hrqol based on a distributed sample located in shaanxi province, china.  <s1> methods a multi-stage stratified cluster sampling method was performed to select subjects. <s2> eq-5d was employed to measure the hrqol. the likelihood that individuals with selected chronic diseases would report any problem in the eq-5d dimensions was calculated and tested relative to that of each of the two reference groups. <s3> multivariable linear regression models were used to investigate factors associated with eq vas.  <s4> results the most frequently reported problems involved pain/discomfort (8.8%) and anxiety/depression (7.6%). <s5> nearly half of the respondents who reported problems in any of the five dimensions were chronic patients. <s6> higher eq vas scores were associated with the male gender, higher level of education, employment, younger age, an urban area of residence, access to free medical service and higher levels of physical activity. <s7> except for anemia, all the selected chronic diseases were indicative of a negative eq vas score. <s8> the three leading risk factors were cerebrovascular disease, cancer and mental disease. <s9> increases in age, number of chronic conditions and frequency of physical activity were found to have a gradient effect.  <s10> conclusion the results of the present work add to the volume of knowledge regarding population health status in this area, apart from the known health status using mortality and morbidity data. <s11> medical, policy, social and individual attention should be given to the management of chronic diseases and improvement of hrqol. longitudinal studies must be performed to monitor changes in hrqol and to permit evaluation of the outcomes of chronic disease intervention programs.

lp+ss: Suboptimal nutrition is a leading cause of premature death <s0> background the global burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors study 2015 provides an up-to-date synthesis of the evidence for risk factor exposure and the attributable burden of disease. <s1> by providing national and subnational assessments spanning the past 25 years, this study can inform debates on the importance of addressing risks in context.  <s2> methods we used the comparative risk assessment framework developed for previous iterations of the global burden of disease study to estimate attributable deaths, disability-adjusted life-years (dalys), and trends in exposure by age group, sex, year, and geography for 79 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks from 1990 to 2015. <s3> this study included 388 risk-outcome pairs that met world cancer research fund-defined criteria for convincing or probable evidence. <s4> we extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from randomised controlled trials, cohorts, pooled cohorts, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources. <s5> we used statistical models to pool data, adjust for bias, and incorporate covariates. <s6> we developed a metric that allows comparisons of exposure across risk factors-the summary exposure value. <s7> using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk level, we estimated the portion of deaths and dalys that could be attributed to a given risk. <s8> we decomposed trends in attributable burden into contributions from population growth, population age structure, risk exposure, and risk-deleted cause-specific daly rates. <s9> we characterised risk exposure in relation to a socio-demographic index (sdi).  <s10> findings between 1990 and 2015, global exposure to unsafe sanitation, household air pollution, childhood underweight, childhood stunting, and smoking each decreased by more than 25%. <s11> global exposure for several occupational risks, high body-mass index (bmi), and drug use increased by more than 25% over the same period. <s12> all risks jointly evaluated in 2015 accounted for 57·8% (95% ci 56·6-58·8) of global deaths and 41·2% (39·8-42·8) of dalys. <s13> in 2015, the ten largest contributors to global dalys among level 3 risks were high systolic blood pressure (211·8 million [192·7 million to 231·1 million] global dalys), smoking (148·6 million [134·2 million to 163·1 million]), high fasting plasma glucose (143·1 million [125·1 million to 163·5 million]), high bmi (120·1 million [83·8 million to 158·4 million]), childhood undernutrition (113·3 million [103·9 million to 123·4 million]), ambient particulate matter (103·1 million [90·8 million to 115·1 million]), high total cholesterol (88·7 million [74·6 million to 105·7 million]), household air pollution (85·6 million [66·7 million to 106·1 million]), alcohol use (85·0 million [77·2 million to 93·0 million]), and diets high in sodium (83·0 million [49·3 million to 127·5 million]). <s14> from 1990 to 2015, attributable dalys declined for micronutrient deficiencies, childhood undernutrition, unsafe sanitation and water, and household air pollution; reductions in risk-deleted daly rates rather than reductions in exposure drove these declines. <s15> rising exposure contributed to notable increases in attributable dalys from high bmi, high fasting plasma glucose, occupational carcinogens, and drug use. <s16> environmental risks and childhood undernutrition declined steadily with sdi; low physical activity, high bmi, and high fasting plasma glucose increased with sdi. <s17> in 119 countries, metabolic risks, such as high bmi and fasting plasma glucose, contributed the most attributable dalys in 2015. <s18> regionally, smoking still ranked among the leading five risk factors for attributable dalys in 109 countries; childhood underweight and unsafe sex remained primary drivers of early death and disability in much of sub-saharan africa.  <s19> interpretation declines in some key environmental risks have contributed to declines in critical infectious diseases. <s20> some risks appear to be invariant to sdi. <s21> increasing risks, including high bmi, high fasting plasma glucose, drug use, and some occupational exposures, contribute to rising burden from some conditions, but also provide opportunities for intervention. <s22> some highly preventable risks, such as smoking, remain major causes of attributable dalys, even as exposure is declining. <s23> public policy makers need to pay attention to the risks that are increasingly major contributors to global burden.  <s24> funding bill & melinda gates foundation.

lp+ss: Sudden death can occur in patients with complex ventricular arrhythmias. <s0> telomerase-negative tumor cells use an alternative lengthening of telomeres (alt) pathway that involves dna recombination and repair to maintain their proliferative potential. <s1> the cytological hallmark of this process is the accumulation of promyelocytic leukemia (pml) nuclear protein at telomeric dna to form alt-associated pml bodies (apbs). <s2> here, the de novo formation of a telomeric pml nuclear subcompartment was investigated by recruiting apb protein components. <s3> we show that functionally distinct proteins were able to initiate the formation of bona fide apbs with high efficiency in a self-organizing and self-propagating manner. <s4> these included: (1) pml and sp100 as the constituting components of pml nuclear bodies, (2) telomere repeat binding factors 1 and 2 (trf1 and trf2, respectively), (3) the dna repair protein nbs1 and (4) the sumo e3 ligase mms21, as well as the isolated sumo1 domain, through an interacting domain of another protein factor. <s5> by contrast, the repair factors rad9, rad17 and rad51 were less efficient in apb nucleation but were recruited to preassembled apbs. <s6> the artificially created apbs induced telomeric extension through a dna repair mechanism, as inferred from their colocalization with sites of non-replicative dna synthesis and histone h2a.x phosphorylation, and an increase of the telomere repeat length. <s7> these activities were absent after recruitment of the apb factors to a pericentric locus and establish apbs as functional intermediates of the alt pathway. 
lp+ss: Sudden death can occur in patients with complex ventricular arrhythmias. <s0> f-box and wd repeat domain-containing 7 (fbw7), the substrate-binding subunit of e3 ubiquitin ligase scffbw7 (a complex of skp1, cullin-1 and fbw7), plays important roles in various physiological and pathological processes. <s1> although fbw7 is required for vascular development, its function in the endothelium remains to be investigated. <s2> in this study, we show that fbw7 is an important regulator of endothelial functions, including angiogenesis, leukocyte adhesion and the endothelial barrier integrity. <s3> using rna interference, we found that the depletion of fbw7 markedly impairs angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. <s4> we identified the zinc finger transcription factor krüppel-like factor 2 (klf2) as a physiological target of fbw7 in endothelial cells. <s5> knockdown of fbw7 expression resulted in the accumulation of endogenous klf2 protein in endothelial cells. <s6> fbw7-mediated klf2 destruction was shown to depend on the phosphorylation of klf2 via glycogen synthase kinase-3 (gsk3) at two conserved phosphodegrons. <s7> mutating these phosphodegron motifs abolished the fbw7-mediated degradation and ubiquitination of klf2. <s8> the sirna-mediated knockdown of fbw7 showed that klf2 is an essential target of fbw7 in the regulation of endothelial functions. <s9> moreover, fbw7-mediated klf2 degradation was shown to be critical for angiogenesis in teratomas and in zebrafish development. <s10> taken together, our study suggests a role for fbw7 in the processes of endothelial cell migration, angiogenesis, inflammation and barrier integrity, and provides novel insights into the regulation of klf2 stability in vivo. 
lp+ss: Sudden death can occur in patients with orthostatic hypertension without cardiac conduction abnormalities. <s0> apoptosis that proceeds via the mitochondrial pathway involves mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (momp), responsible for the release of cytochrome c and other proteins of the mitochondrial intermembrane space. <s1> this essential step is controlled and mediated by proteins of the bcl-2 family. <s2> the proapoptotic proteins bax and bak are required for momp, while the antiapoptotic bcl-2 proteins, including bcl-2, bcl-xl, mcl-1, and others, prevent momp. <s3> different proapoptotic bh3-only proteins act to interfere with the function of the antiapoptotic bcl-2 members and/or activate bax and bak. <s4> here, we discuss an emerging view, proposed by certo et al. in this issue of cancer cell, on how these interactions result in momp and apoptosis. 
lp+ss: Surfactin producing cells and exopolymer producing cells cooperate to generate "Van Gogh" bundles that have sliding abilities on specialized media. <s0> the organization of cells, emerging from cell-cell interactions, can give rise to collective properties. <s1> these properties are adaptive when together cells can face environmental challenges that they separately cannot. <s2> one particular challenge that is important for microorganisms is migration. <s3> in this study, we show how flagellum-independent migration is driven by the division of labor of two cell types that appear during bacillus subtilis sliding motility. <s4> cell collectives organize themselves into bundles (called "van gogh bundles") of tightly aligned cell chains that form filamentous loops at the colony edge. <s5> we show, by time-course microscopy, that these loops migrate by pushing themselves away from the colony. <s6> the formation of van gogh bundles depends critically on the synergistic interaction of surfactin-producing and matrix-producing cells. <s7> we propose that surfactin-producing cells reduce the friction between cells and their substrate, thereby facilitating matrix-producing cells to form bundles. <s8> the folding properties of these bundles determine the rate of colony expansion. <s9> our study illustrates how the simple organization of cells within a community can yield a strong ecological advantage. <s10> this is a key factor underlying the diverse origins of multicellularity.

lp+ss: Surfactin producing cells and exopolymer producing cells cooperate to generate "Van Gogh" bundles that have sliding abilities on specialized media. <s0> infection of sulfolobus islandicus rey15a with mixtures of different sulfolobus viruses, including stsv2, did not induce spacer acquisition by the host crispr immune system. <s1> however, coinfection with the tailed fusiform viruses smv1 and stsv2 generated hyperactive spacer acquisition in both crispr loci, exclusively from stsv2, with the resultant loss of stsv2 but not smv1. <s2> smv1 was shown to activate adaptation while itself being resistant to crispr-mediated adaptation and dna interference. <s3> exceptionally, a single clone s-1 isolated from an smv1 + stsv2-infected culture, that carried stsv2-specific spacers and had lost stsv2 but not smv1, acquired spacers from smv1. <s4> this effect was also reproducible on reinfecting wild-type host cells with a variant smv1 isolated from the s-1 culture. <s5> the smv1 variant lacked a virion protein orf114 that was shown to bind dna. <s6> this study also provided evidence for: (i) limits on the maximum sizes of crispr loci; (ii) spacer uptake strongly retarding growth of infected cultures; (iii) protospacer selection being essentially random and non-directional, and (iv) the reversible uptake of spacers from stsv2 and smv1. <s7> a hypothesis is presented to explain the interactive conflicts between smv1 and the host crispr immune system.

lp+ss: Sweet taste receptors on the tongue are deactivated by between 1 and 10 mM glucose. <s0> context for the last 40 yr, the first line of treatment for anovulation in infertile women has been clomiphene citrate (cc). <s1> cc is a safe, effective oral agent but is known to have relatively common antiestrogenic endometrial and cervical mucous side effects that could prevent pregnancy in the face of successful ovulation. <s2> in addition, there is a significant risk of multiple pregnancy with cc, compared with natural cycles. <s3> because of these problems, we proposed the concept of aromatase inhibition as a new method of ovulation induction that could avoid many of the adverse effects of cc. <s4> the objective of this review was to describe the different physiological mechanisms of action for cc and aromatase inhibitors (ais) and compare studies of efficacy for both agents for ovulation induction.    <s5> evidence acquisition we conducted a systematic review of all the published studies, both controlled and noncontrolled, comparing cc and ai treatment, either alone or in combination with gonadotropins, for ovulation induction or augmentation, identified through the entrez-pubmed search engine.    <s6> evidence synthesis because of the recent acceptance of the concept of using ais for ovulation induction, few controlled studies were identified, and the rest of the studies were pilot or preliminary comparisons. <s7> based on these studies, it appears that ais are as effective as cc in inducing ovulation, are devoid of any antiestrogenic side effects, result in lower serum estrogen concentrations, and are associated with good pregnancy rates with a lower incidence of multiple pregnancy than cc. <s8> when combined with gonadotropins for assisted reproductive technologies, ais reduce the dose of fsh required for optimal follicle recruitment and improve the response to fsh in poor responders.  <s9> conclusions preliminary evidence suggests that ais may replace cc in the future because of similar efficacy with a reduced side effect profile. <s10> although worldwide experience with ais for ovulation induction is increasing, at present, definitive studies in the form of randomized controlled trials comparing cc with ais are lacking.

lp+ss: Sympathetic nerve activity is elevated throughout normal pregnancy. <s0> background direct recordings from peripheral sympathetic nerves have shown an increased sympathetic drive in pregnancy-induced hypertension (pih) and preeclampsia (pe). <s1> it is unknown whether sympathetic drive is altered in normal pregnancy, when arterial blood pressure can be normal or relatively low. <s2> the aim of this study was to measure and compare peripheral sympathetic discharge, its vasoconstrictor effect and its baroreceptor control, during pregnancy and postpartum in women with normal pregnancy (np) and pih and in normotensive nonpregnant (nn) women.  <s3> methods and results twenty-one women with np, 18 women with pih, and 21 nn women had muscle sympathetic nerve activity assessed from multiunit discharges (msna) and from single units with defined vasoconstrictor properties (s-msna). <s4> the s-msna in np (38+/-6.6 impulses/100 beats) was greater (p<0.05) than in nn women (19+/-1.8 impulses/100 beats) despite similar age and body weight but less than in pih women (p<0.001) (146+/-23.5 impulses/100 beats). <s5> msna followed a similar trend. <s6> cardiac baroreceptor reflex sensitivity (brs) was impaired in np and pih women relative to nn. <s7> after delivery, sympathetic activity decreased to values similar to those obtained in nn, and there was an increase in brs. <s8> in women with np, the decrease in sympathetic output occurred despite an insignificant change in blood pressure.  <s9> conclusions central sympathetic output was increased in women with normal pregnancy and was even greater in the hypertensive pregnant group. <s10> the findings suggest that the moderate sympathetic hyperactivity during the latter months of normal pregnancy may help to return the arterial pressure to nonpregnant levels, although when the increase in activity is excessive, hypertension may ensue.

lp+ss: Systemic immunosuppressive (IS) therapy does not enhance the chance of cancer mortality in patients with inflammatory eye disease (IED) <s0> the loss of a glutamic acid residue in the aaa-atpase (atpases associated with diverse cellular activities) torsina is responsible for most cases of early onset autosomal dominant primary dystonia. <s1> in this study, we found that snapin, which binds snap-25 (synaptosome-associated protein of 25,000 da) and enhances the association of the snare complex with synaptotagmin, is an interacting partner for both wild type and mutant torsina. snapin co-localized with endogenous torsina on dense core granules in pc12 cells and was recruited to perinuclear inclusions containing mutant deltae-torsina in neuroblastoma sh-sy5y cells. <s2> in view of these observations, synaptic vesicle recycling was analyzed using the lipophilic dye fm1-43 and an antibody directed against an intravesicular epitope of synaptotagmin i. we found that overexpression of wild type torsina negatively affects synaptic vesicle endocytosis. <s3> conversely, overexpression of deltae-torsina in neuroblastoma cells increases fm1-43 uptake. <s4> knockdown of snapin and/or torsina using small interfering rnas had a similar inhibitory effect on the exo-endocytic process. <s5> in addition, down-regulation of torsina causes the persistence of synaptotagmin i on the plasma membrane, which closely resembles the effect observed by the overexpression of the deltae-torsina mutant. <s6> altogether, these findings suggest that torsina plays a role together with snapin in regulated exocytosis and that deltae-torsina exerts its pathological effects through a loss of function mechanism. <s7> this may affect neuronal uptake of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, playing a role in the development of dystonic movements. 
lp+ss: Systemic immunosuppressive (IS) therapy does not enhance the chance of cancer mortality in patients with inflammatory eye disease (IED) <s0> [purpose] the present study examined whether electro-acupuncture therapy reduces post-stroke depression (psd) and whether motor function impairments interact with the effects of the therapy. <s1> [subjects] twenty-eight psd patients were assessed and assigned to either a good or poor motor function group depending on their motor grade. <s2> [methods] the beck depression inventory (bdi), hamilton depression rating scale (hdrs) and manual muscle test (mmt) were administered at the screening and initial phases of the study, and at the 4th, 8th, 12th and 16th week of the daily electro-acupuncture treatment. <s3> [results] the electro-acupuncture treatment reduced psd (as assessed by bdi and hdrs) of the patients. <s4> in particular, the depression of the good motor function group was significantly more reduced than that of the poor motor function group. <s5> the degree of motor function impairment did not change throughout the study in either group. <s6> [conclusion] the results of the present study demonstrate that electro-acupuncture therapy can improve psd, and that the treatment effect varies depending on the degree of motor function impairment.

lp+ss: T cell receptor /CD3 microdomains are required to induce the immunologic synapse. <s0> t cell receptor (tcr-cd3) triggering involves both receptor clustering and conformational changes at the cytoplasmic tails of the cd3 subunits. <s1> the mechanism by which tcralphabeta ligand binding confers conformational changes to cd3 is unknown. <s2> by using well-defined ligands, we showed that induction of the conformational change requires both multivalent engagement and the mobility restriction of the tcr-cd3 imposed by the plasma membrane. <s3> the conformational change is elicited by cooperative rearrangements of two tcr-cd3 complexes and does not require accompanying changes in the structure of the tcralphabeta ectodomains. <s4> this conformational change at cd3 reverts upon ligand dissociation and is required for t cell activation. <s5> thus, our permissive geometry model provides a molecular mechanism that rationalizes how the information of ligand binding to tcralphabeta is transmitted to the cd3 subunits and to the intracellular signaling machinery.

lp+ss: T cell receptor /CD3 microdomains are required to induce the immunologic synapse. <s0> whole cell patch-clamp recordings were made from sympathetic preganglionic neurons (spns) in the intermediolateral cell column of thoracolumbar spinal cord slices of 12- to 16-day-old rats, and the effects of pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (pacap)-38 on n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda)- and kainate (ka)-induced inward currents were examined. <s1> pacap, in concentrations (10-30 nm) that caused no significant change of holding currents, reversibly increased nmda-induced currents but not ka-induced currents. <s2> at higher concentrations (>30 nm), the peptide produced a sustained inward current. <s3> the potentiating effect of pacap was nullified by prior incubation of the slices with the adenylate cyclase inhibitor mdl-12,330a (25 microm). <s4> further, superfusing the slices with the membrane-permeable cyclic amp analogue n6,2'-o-dibutyryladenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (100-300 microm) in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (700 microm) increased the nmda currents. <s5> this result suggests that pacap selectively increases nmda-receptor-mediated responses in the rat spns, probably via a cyclic-amp-dependent mechanism, providing evidence that the peptide may be involved in synaptic plasticity. 
lp+ss: T cell receptor /CD3 microdomains are required to induce the immunologic synapse. <s0> t cell receptor (tcr) signaling is initiated and sustained in microclusters; however, it's not known whether signaling also occurs in the tcr-rich central supramolecular activation cluster (csmac). <s1> we showed that the csmac formed by fusion of microclusters contained more cd45 than microclusters and is a site enriched in lysobisphosphatidic acid, a lipid involved in sorting ubiquitinated membrane proteins for degradation. <s2> calcium signaling via tcr was blocked within 2 min by anti-mhcp treatment and 1 min by latrunculin-a treatment. <s3> tcr-mhcp interactions in the csmac survived these perturbations for 10 min and hence were not sufficient to sustain signaling. <s4> tcr microclusters were also resistant to disruption by anti-mhcp and latrunculin-a treatments. <s5> we propose that tcr signaling is sustained by stabilized microclusters and is terminated in the csmac, a structure from which tcr are sorted for degradation. <s6> our studies reveal a role for f-actin in tcr signaling beyond microcluster formation.

lp+ss: TRAP+ osteoclasts regulate mature osteoblast maintenance. <s0> background alcohol is a contributing cause of unintentional injuries, such as motor vehicle crashes. <s1> prior research on the association between alcohol use and violent injury was limited to survey-based data, and the inclusion of cases from a single trauma centre, without adequate controls. <s2> beyond these limitations was the inability of prior researchers to comprehensively capture most alcohol sales. <s3> in ontario, most alcohol is sold through retail outlets run by the provincial government, and hospitals are financed under a provincial health care system. <s4> we assessed the risk of being hospitalized due to assault in association with retail alcohol sales across ontario.  <s5> methods and findings we performed a population-based case-crossover analysis of all persons aged 13 years and older hospitalized for assault in ontario from 1 april 2002 to 1 december 2004. <s6> on the day prior to each assault case's hospitalization, the volume of alcohol sold at the store in closest proximity to the victim's home was compared to the volume of alcohol sold at the same store 7 d earlier. <s7> conditional logistic regression analysis was used to determine the associated relative risk (rr) of assault per 1,000 l higher daily sales of alcohol. <s8> of the 3,212 persons admitted to hospital for assault, nearly 25% were between the ages of 13 and 20 y, and 83% were male. <s9> a total of 1,150 assaults (36%) involved the use of a sharp or blunt weapon, and 1,532 (48%) arose during an unarmed brawl or fight. <s10> for every 1,000 l more of alcohol sold per store per day, the relative risk of being hospitalized for assault was 1.13 (95% confidence interval [ci] 1.02-1.26). <s11> the risk was accentuated for males (1.18, 95% ci 1.05-1.33), youth aged 13 to 20 y (1.21, 95% ci 0.99-1.46), and those in urban areas (1.19, 95% ci 1.06-1.35).  <s12> conclusions the risk of being a victim of serious assault increases with alcohol sales, especially among young urban men. <s13> akin to reducing the risk of driving while impaired, consideration should be given to novel methods of preventing alcohol-related violence.

lp+ss: Taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages reduced the incidence rate of type II diabetes in India. <s0> background taxing sugar-sweetened beverages (ssbs) has been proposed in high-income countries to reduce obesity and type 2 diabetes. <s1> we sought to estimate the potential health effects of such a fiscal strategy in the middle-income country of india, where there is heterogeneity in ssb consumption, patterns of substitution between ssbs and other beverages after tax increases, and vast differences in chronic disease risk within the population.  <s2> methods and findings using consumption and price variations data from a nationally representative survey of 100,855 indian households, we first calculated how changes in ssb price alter per capita consumption of ssbs and substitution with other beverages. <s3> we then incorporated ssb sales trends, body mass index (bmi), and diabetes incidence data stratified by age, sex, income, and urban/rural residence into a validated microsimulation of caloric consumption, glycemic load, overweight/obesity prevalence, and type 2 diabetes incidence among indian subpopulations facing a 20% ssb excise tax. <s4> the 20% ssb tax was anticipated to reduce overweight and obesity prevalence by 3.0% (95% ci 1.6%-5.9%) and type 2 diabetes incidence by 1.6% (95% ci 1.2%-1.9%) among various indian subpopulations over the period 2014-2023, if ssb consumption continued to increase linearly in accordance with secular trends. <s5> however, acceleration in ssb consumption trends consistent with industry marketing models would be expected to increase the impact efficacy of taxation, averting 4.2% of prevalent overweight/obesity (95% ci 2.5-10.0%) and 2.5% (95% ci 1.0-2.8%) of incident type 2 diabetes from 2014-2023. <s6> given current consumption and bmi distributions, our results suggest the largest relative effect would be expected among young rural men, refuting our a priori hypothesis that urban populations would be isolated beneficiaries of ssb taxation. <s7> key limitations of this estimation approach include the assumption that consumer expenditure behavior from prior years, captured in price elasticities, will reflect future behavior among consumers, and potential underreporting of consumption in dietary recall data used to inform our calculations.  <s8> conclusion sustained ssb taxation at a high tax rate could mitigate rising obesity and type 2 diabetes in india among both urban and rural subpopulations.

lp+ss: Ten percent (10%) of kidney cancers in the UK are attributable to excess weight. <s0> autophagy is the principal catabolic response to nutrient starvation and is necessary to clear dysfunctional or damaged organelles, but excessive autophagy can be cytotoxic or cytostatic and contributes to cell death. <s1> depending on the abundance of enzymes involved in molecule biosynthesis, cells can be dependent on uptake of exogenous nutrients to provide these molecules. <s2> argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ass1) is a key enzyme in arginine biosynthesis, and its abundance is reduced in many solid tumors, making them sensitive to external arginine depletion. <s3> we demonstrated that prolonged arginine starvation by exposure to adi-peg20 (pegylated arginine deiminase) induced autophagy-dependent death of ass1-deficient breast cancer cells, because these cells are arginine auxotrophs (dependent on uptake of extracellular arginine). <s4> indeed, these breast cancer cells died in culture when exposed to adi-peg20 or cultured in the absence of arginine. <s5> arginine starvation induced mitochondrial oxidative stress, which impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics and integrity. <s6> furthermore, arginine starvation killed breast cancer cells in vivo and in vitro only if they were autophagy-competent. <s7> thus, a key mechanism underlying the lethality induced by prolonged arginine starvation was the cytotoxic autophagy that occurred in response to mitochondrial damage. <s8> last, ass1 was either low in abundance or absent in more than 60% of 149 random breast cancer biosamples, suggesting that patients with such tumors could be candidates for arginine starvation therapy.

lp+ss: The DdrB protein from Deinococcus radiodurans functions as a pentamer. <s0> acute myelogenous leukemia (aml) is an aggressive cancer that strikes both adults and children and is frequently resistant to therapy. <s1> thus, identifying signals needed for aml propagation is a critical step toward developing new approaches for treating this disease. <s2> here, we show that tetraspanin 3 is a target of the rna binding protein musashi 2, which plays a key role in aml. <s3> we generated tspan3 knockout mice that were born without overt defects. <s4> however, tspan3 deletion impaired leukemia stem cell self-renewal and disease propagation and markedly improved survival in mouse models of aml. <s5> additionally, tspan3 inhibition blocked growth of aml patient samples, suggesting that tspan3 is also important in human disease. <s6> as part of the mechanism, we show that tspan3 deficiency disabled responses to cxcl12/sdf-1 and led to defects in aml localization within the niche. <s7> these identify tspan3 as an important regulator of aggressive leukemias and highlight a role for tspan3 in oncogenesis. 
lp+ss: The G34R/V mutation creates a hypomethylated phenotype at the H3K36 histone. <s0> cathelicidins are a novel family of antimicrobial peptide precursors from mammalian myeloid cells. <s1> they are characterized by a conserved n-terminal region while the c-terminal antimicrobial domain can vary considerably in both primary sequence and length. <s2> four cathelicidins, probac5, probac7, prododecapeptide and probmap-28, have been concurrently purified from bovine neutrophils, using simple and rapid methodologies. <s3> the correlation of es-ms data from the purified proteins with their cdna-deduced sequences has revealed several common features of their primary sequence, such as the presence of n-terminal 5-oxoproline (pyroglutamate) residues and two disulfide bridges in a 1-2, 3-4 arrangement. <s4> the n-terminal domains of the cathelicidins present one or two asp-pro bonds, which are particularly acid-labile in probac5 and probac7, but stable in prododecapeptide. <s5> this suggests that the spatial organization around these bonds may vary in different cathelicidins, and favour hydrolysis in some cases. <s6> an unexpected feature of the prododecapeptide is that it exists as dimers formed by three possible combinations of its two isoforms. <s7> the isolation of a truncated, monomeric form of this protein, lacking the cysteine-containing antimicrobial dodecapeptide, indicates that dimerization occurs via disulfide bridge formation at the level of the c-terminal domain and that the dodecapeptide is likely released as a dimer from its precursor. <s8> sequence-based secondary structure predictions and cd results indicate for cathelicidins a 30-50% content of extended conformation and <20% content of alpha-helical conformation, with the alpha-helical segment placed near the n-terminus. <s9> finally, similarity searching and topology-based structure prediction underline a significant sequential and structural similarity between the conserved n-terminal domain of cathelicidins and cystatin-like domains, placing this family within the cystatin superfamily. <s10> when assayed against cathepsin l, unlike the potent cystatin inhibitors, three of the four cathelicidins show only a poor inhibitory activity (ki = 0.6-3 microm). 
lp+ss: The G34R/V mutation does not create a hypomethylated phenotype at the H3K36 histone. <s0> intensive study of a few genetically tractable species with xx/xy sex chromosomes has produced generalizations about the process of sex chromosome dosage compensation that do not fare well when applied to zz/zw sex chromosome systems, such as those in birds. <s1> the inherent sexual imbalance in dose of sex chromosome genes has led to the evolution of sex-chromosome-wide mechanisms for balancing gene dosage between the sexes and relative to autosomal genes. <s2> recent advances in our knowledge of avian genomes have led to a reexamination of sex-specific dosage compensation (ssdc) in birds, which is less effective than in known xx/xy systems. <s3> insights about the mechanisms of ssdc in birds also suggest similarities to and differences from those in xx/xy species. <s4> birds are thus offering new opportunities for studying dosage compensation in a zz/zw system, which should shed light on the evolution of ssdc more broadly. 
lp+ss: The H2A-H2B eviction defect is compensated for by other histone chaperone(s). <s0> stromal-interaction molecule 1 (stim1) is an endoplasmic reticulum ca(2+) storage sensor that promotes cell growth, migration, and angiogenesis in breast and cervical cancers. <s1> here, we report that the microtubule-associated histone deacetylase 6 (hdac6) differentially regulates activation of stim1-mediated store-operated ca(2+) entry (soce) between cervical cancer cells and normal cervical epithelial cells. <s2> confocal microscopy of living cells indicated that microtubule integrity was necessary for stim1 trafficking to the plasma membrane and interaction with orai1, an essential pore subunit of soce. <s3> cancer cells overexpressed both stim1 and orai1 compared with normal cervical epithelial cells. <s4> hdac6 upregulation in cancer cells was accompanied by hypoacetylated α-tubulin. <s5> tubastatin-a, a specific hdac6 inhibitor, inhibited stim1 translocation to plasma membrane and blocked soce activation in cancer cells but not normal epithelial cells. <s6> genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of hdac6 blocked stim1 membrane trafficking and downstream ca(2+) influx, as evidenced by total internal reflection fluorescent images and intracellular ca(2+) determination. <s7> in contrast, hdac6 inhibition did not affect interactions between stim1 and the microtubule plus end-binding protein eb1. <s8> analysis of surgical specimens confirmed that most cervical cancer tissues overexpressed stim1 and orai1, accompanied by hypoacetylated α-tubulin. <s9> together, our results identify hdac6 as a candidate target to disrupt stim1-mediated soce as a general strategy to block malignant cell behavior. 
lp+ss: The H2A-H2B eviction defect is compensated for by other histone chaperone(s). <s0> background ulcerative colitis (uc) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease in which the colonic mucosa is infiltrated with plasma cells producing igg autoantibodies. <s1> it is not known whether this represents a local mucosal response which has switched to igg or a peripheral response which may have been initiated by peripheral antigen which homed to the colonic mucosa. <s2> the clonal distribution of igg secreting cells and isotype switched variants in uc is not known.    <s3> aims to investigate the clonal distribution of mucosal igg in uc and to search for related igg and iga secreting cells in normal and diseased mucosa and blood in uc. <s4> to investigate characteristics which may discriminate between the mucosal and peripheral repertoire in the normal mucosa and in uc.  <s5> patients blood and normal and diseased mucosa from two patients with uc were studied.  <s6> methods immunoglobulin gene analysis and clone specific polymerase chain reaction were used to study the clonal distribution and characteristics of igg and related iga in the mucosa and blood of patients with uc.  <s7> results the igg response in the mucosa of uc patients included widespread clones of cells that were present in both the diseased mucosa and blood but that were scarce in normal mucosa. <s8> clonally related iga class switch variants, all iga1, were detected but also only in the diseased mucosa and blood. <s9> this suggests that these clones home preferentially to the diseased mucosa. <s10> we showed that j(h)1 usage was characteristic of the peripheral repertoire, and that examples of j(h)1 usage were observed in mucosal igg in uc.  <s11> conclusions overall, these data are consistent with a model of uc in which a peripheral response is expressed and expanded in the colonic mucosa. 
lp+ss: The HSV-2 infection is typically asymptomatic. <s0> p53 is a crucial tumour suppressor that responds to diverse stress signals by orchestrating specific cellular responses, including transient cell cycle arrest, cellular senescence and apoptosis, which are all processes associated with tumour suppression. <s1> however, recent studies have challenged the relative importance of these canonical cellular responses for p53-mediated tumour suppression and have highlighted roles for p53 in modulating other cellular processes, including metabolism, stem cell maintenance, invasion and metastasis, as well as communication within the tumour microenvironment. <s2> in this opinion article, we discuss the roles of classical p53 functions, as well as emerging p53-regulated processes, in tumour suppression. 
lp+ss: The M2-phenotype in brown adipose tissue macrophages increases brown adipose tissue thermogenic activity. <s0> all homeotherms use thermogenesis to maintain their core body temperature, ensuring that cellular functions and physiological processes can continue in cold environments. <s1> in the prevailing model of thermogenesis, when the hypothalamus senses cold temperatures it triggers sympathetic discharge, resulting in the release of noradrenaline in brown adipose tissue and white adipose tissue. <s2> acting via the β(3)-adrenergic receptors, noradrenaline induces lipolysis in white adipocytes, whereas it stimulates the expression of thermogenic genes, such as ppar-γ coactivator 1a (ppargc1a), uncoupling protein 1 (ucp1) and acyl-coa synthetase long-chain family member 1 (acsl1), in brown adipocytes. <s3> however, the precise nature of all the cell types involved in this efferent loop is not well established. <s4> here we report in mice an unexpected requirement for the interleukin-4 (il-4)-stimulated program of alternative macrophage activation in adaptive thermogenesis. <s5> exposure to cold temperature rapidly promoted alternative activation of adipose tissue macrophages, which secrete catecholamines to induce thermogenic gene expression in brown adipose tissue and lipolysis in white adipose tissue. <s6> absence of alternatively activated macrophages impaired metabolic adaptations to cold, whereas administration of il-4 increased thermogenic gene expression, fatty acid mobilization and energy expenditure, all in a macrophage-dependent manner. <s7> thus, we have discovered a role for alternatively activated macrophages in the orchestration of an important mammalian stress response, the response to cold.

lp+ss: The PPR MDA5 has twenty N-terminal CARD domains. <s0> background saphenous vein graft (vg) failure occurs more frequently compared with arterial grafts, and graft thrombosis represents the main cause of early occlusion. <s1> because cd40-cd40l pathway cd40 represents a culprit link between local inflammation and coagulation cascade, we investigate the role of cd40 and its soluble ligand (scd40l) in the immediate in vitro response of vg to arterial pressures, and the potential effects of simvastatin (merck sharp&dohme, white-house station, nj) supplementation.  <s2> methods samples of saphenous vein and of internal mammary artery (ima) were obtained from sixteen patients without history of statin therapy. <s3> segments underwent pulsatile pressure distension and culture with or without supplementation of simvastatin. <s4> cd40 and scd40l were assessed in tissue lysate and in culture supernatant, respectively. <s5> scd40l serum concentrations were also measured.  <s6> results during the course of the experiment, the cd40 expression was significantly lower in ima samples compared with both distended and not distended vg. <s7> pressure distension up-regulated the production of cd40 in vg segments after 24 and 48 h. statin supplementation significantly reduced the expression of cd40 in both venous (p < 0.001) and arterial samples (p < 0.001). <s8> this effect of simvastatin was not affected by the treatment with l-name, but it was reversed by the addition of mevalonic acid. <s9> mean scd40l content in culture supernatants increased over time, suggesting that not only platelets but also the vessel wall is a source of cd40 and scd40l.  <s10> conclusions simvastatin treatment modulates endothelial cd40-scd40l in both venous and arterial grafts, and therefore may represent a useful tool in the pharmacological prevention of graft failure.

lp+ss: The PRDM1 gene, when combined with the PRDM14 gene, plays an important role during primordial germ cell specification. <s0> quantitative measurement of nf-kappab nuclear translocation is an important research tool in cellular immunology. <s1> established methodologies have a number of limitations, such as poor sensitivity, high cost or dependence on cell lines. <s2> novel imaging methods to measure nuclear translocation of transcriptionally active components of nf-kappab are being used but are also partly limited by the need for specialist imaging equipment or image analysis software. <s3> herein we present a method for quantitative detection of nf-kappab rel a nuclear translocation, using immunofluorescence microscopy and the public domain image analysis software imagej that can be easily adopted for cellular immunology research without the need for specialist image analysis expertise and at low cost. <s4> the method presented here is validated by demonstrating the time course and dose response of nf-kappab nuclear translocation in primary human macrophages stimulated with lps, and by comparison with a commercial nf-kappab activation reporter cell line. 
lp+ss: The PRR MDA5 has a C-terminal domain. <s0> mosquito-borne viruses cause significant levels of morbidity and mortality in humans and domesticated animals. <s1> maintenance of mosquito-borne viruses in nature requires a biological transmission cycle that involves alternating virus replication in a susceptible vertebrate and mosquito host. <s2> although the vertebrate infection is acute and often associated with disease, continual transmission of these viruses in nature depends on the establishment of a persistent, nonpathogenic infection in the mosquito vector. <s3> an antiviral rnai response has been shown to limit the replication of rna viruses in flies. <s4> however, the importance of the rnai pathway as an antiviral defense in mammals is unclear. <s5> differences in the immune responses of mammals and mosquitoes may explain why these viruses are not generally associated with pathology in the invertebrate host. <s6> we identified virus-derived small interfering rnas (virnas), 21 nt in length, in aedes aegypti infected with the mosquito-borne virus, sindbis (sinv). <s7> virnas had an asymmetric distribution that spanned the length of the sinv genome. <s8> to determine the role of virnas in controlling pathogenic potential, mosquitoes were infected with recombinant alphaviruses expressing suppressors of rna silencing. <s9> decreased survival was observed in mosquitoes in which the accumulation of virnas was suppressed. <s10> these results suggest that an exogenous sirna pathway is essential to the survival of mosquitoes infected with alphaviruses and, thus, the maintenance of these viruses in nature. 
lp+ss: The PRR MDA5 has a C-terminal domain. <s0> background & aims gs-9620, an oral agonist of toll-like receptor 7 (tlr7), is in clinical development for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b (chb). <s1> gs-9620 was previously shown to induce prolonged suppression of serum viral dna and antigens in the woodchuck and chimpanzee models of chb. <s2> herein, we investigated the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the antiviral response to gs-9620 using in vitro models of hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection.  <s3> methods cryopreserved primary human hepatocytes (phh) and differentiated heparg (dheparg) cells were infected with hbv and treated with gs-9620, conditioned media from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells treated with gs-9620 (gs-9620 conditioned media [gs-9620-cm]), or other innate immune stimuli. <s4> the antiviral and transcriptional response to these agents was determined.  <s5> results gs-9620 had no antiviral activity in hbv-infected phh, consistent with low level tlr7 mrna expression in human hepatocytes. <s6> in contrast, gs-9620-cm induced prolonged reduction of hbv dna, rna, and antigen levels in phh and dheparg cells via a type i interferon (ifn)-dependent mechanism. <s7> gs-9620-cm did not reduce covalently closed circular dna (cccdna) levels in either cell type. <s8> transcriptional profiling demonstrated that gs-9620-cm strongly induced various hbv restriction factors - although not apobec3a or the smc5/6 complex - and indicated that established hbv infection does not modulate innate immune sensing or signaling in cryopreserved phh. <s9> gs-9620-cm also induced expression of immunoproteasome subunits and enhanced presentation of an immunodominant viral peptide in hbv-infected phh.  <s10> conclusions type i ifn induced by gs-9620 durably suppressed hbv in human hepatocytes without reducing cccdna levels. <s11> moreover, hbv antigen presentation was enhanced, suggesting additional components of the tlr7-induced immune response played a role in the antiviral response to gs-9620 in animal models of chb.    <s12> lay summary gs-9620 is a drug currently being tested in clinical trials for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection. <s13> gs-9620 has previously been shown to suppress hbv in various animal models, but the underlying antiviral mechanisms were not completely understood. <s14> in this study, we determined that gs-9620 does not directly activate antiviral pathways in human liver cells, but can induce prolonged suppression of hbv via induction of an antiviral cytokine called interferon. <s15> however, interferon did not destroy the hbv genome, suggesting that other parts of the immune response (e.g. activation of immune cells that kill infected cells) also play an important role in the antiviral response to gs-9620.

lp+ss: The US health care system can save up to $5 billion if 7% of patients waiting for kidney transplants participate in the optimized national kidney paired donation program. <s0> pre-mrna splicing is a fundamental process required for the expression of most metazoan genes. <s1> it is carried out by the spliceosome, which catalyzes the removal of noncoding intronic sequences to assemble exons into mature mrnas prior to export and translation. <s2> given the complexity of higher eukaryotic genes and the relatively low level of splice site conservation, the precision of the splicing machinery in recognizing and pairing splice sites is impressive. <s3> introns ranging in size from <100 up to 100,000 bases are removed efficiently. <s4> at the same time, a large number of alternative splicing events are observed between different cell types, during development, or during other biological processes. <s5> this extensive alternative splicing implies a significant flexibility of the spliceosome to identify and process exons within a given pre-mrna. <s6> to reach this flexibility, splice site selection in higher eukaryotes has evolved to depend on multiple parameters such as splice site strength, the presence or absence of splicing regulators, rna secondary structures, the exon/intron architecture, and the process of pre-mrna synthesis itself. <s7> the relative contributions of each of these parameters control how efficiently splice sites are recognized and flanking introns are removed. 
lp+ss: The World Health Organization's (WHO) data collection process is biased downward by unequal selection of larger outbreaks. <s0> two synthetic peripheral nerve myelin p0 protein peptides, an immunodominant (amino acids 180-199) and a cryptic (amino acids 56-71) one, induced an acute or chronic course of experimental autoimmune neuritis (ean) in lewis rats, when given at low dose (50-100 microg/rat) or high dose (250 microg/rat), respectively. <s1> corresponding to the different clinical course, pathological changes and immune responses were found: (1) onset of clinical signs of p0 peptide 56-71 (p0 56-71) induced ean was 1-3 days later than in p0 peptide 180-199 (p0 180-199) induced ean at all immunizing doses, whereas the peak of the disease occurred at a similar time point post immunization (p.i.), i.e. at days 14-16 p.i. <s2> in p0 56-71 induced ean and at day 16 p.i. <s3> in p0 180-199 induced ean. <s4> (2) intramolecular epitope spreading as assessed by delayed type hypersensitivity response occurred in p0 56-71 induced ean at both low and high antigen doses and in p0 180-199 induced ean at high antigen dose (250 microg/rat) only. <s5> (3) p0 180-199 stimulated higher levels of interferon-gamma production in p0 180-199 induced ean than in p0 56-71 induced ean and vice versa. <s6> (4) histopathologic evaluation revealed a similar grade of mononuclear cell infiltration in the sciatic nerves of both types of ean, but more severe demyelination was found in p0 180-199 induced ean compared to p0 56-71 induced ean. <s7> the results support the hypothesis that high dose autoantigen immunization induces extensive determinant spreading and chronic course of autoimmune diseases. 
lp+ss: The ability of activator E2Fs in preventing cell death is limited to terminally differentiated cells. <s0> in the established model of mammalian cell cycle control, the retinoblastoma protein (rb) functions to restrict cells from entering s phase by binding and sequestering e2f activators (e2f1, e2f2 and e2f3), which are invariably portrayed as the ultimate effectors of a transcriptional program that commit cells to enter and progress through s phase. <s1> using a panel of tissue-specific cre-transgenic mice and conditional e2f alleles we examined the effects of e2f1, e2f2 and e2f3 triple deficiency in murine embryonic stem cells, embryos and small intestines. <s2> we show that in normal dividing progenitor cells e2f1-3 function as transcriptional activators, but contrary to the current view, are dispensable for cell division and instead are necessary for cell survival. <s3> in differentiating cells e2f1-3 function in a complex with rb as repressors to silence e2f targets and facilitate exit from the cell cycle. <s4> the inactivation of rb in differentiating cells resulted in a switch of e2f1-3 from repressors to activators, leading to the superactivation of e2f responsive targets and ectopic cell divisions. <s5> loss of e2f1-3 completely suppressed these phenotypes caused by rb deficiency. <s6> this work contextualizes the activator versus repressor functions of e2f1-3 in vivo, revealing distinct roles in dividing versus differentiating cells and in normal versus cancer-like cell cycles. 
lp+ss: The ability of activator E2Fs in preventing cell death is limited to terminally differentiated cells. <s0> ribosomopathies compose a collection of disorders in which genetic abnormalities cause impaired ribosome biogenesis and function, resulting in specific clinical phenotypes. <s1> congenital mutations in rps19 and other genes encoding ribosomal proteins cause diamond-blackfan anemia, a disorder characterized by hypoplastic, macrocytic anemia. <s2> mutations in other genes required for normal ribosome biogenesis have been implicated in other rare congenital syndromes, schwachman-diamond syndrome, dyskeratosis congenita, cartilage hair hypoplasia, and treacher collins syndrome. <s3> in addition, the 5q- syndrome, a subtype of myelodysplastic syndrome, is caused by a somatically acquired deletion of chromosome 5q, which leads to haploinsufficiency of the ribosomal protein rps14 and an erythroid phenotype highly similar to diamond-blackfan anemia. <s4> acquired abnormalities in ribosome function have been implicated more broadly in human malignancies. <s5> the p53 pathway provides a surveillance mechanism for protein translation as well as genome integrity and is activated by defects in ribosome biogenesis; this pathway appears to be a critical mediator of many of the clinical features of ribosomopathies. <s6> elucidation of the mechanisms whereby selective abnormalities in ribosome biogenesis cause specific clinical syndromes will hopefully lead to novel therapeutic strategies for these diseases. 
lp+ss: The amount of publicly available DNA data doubles every 10 months. <s0> octreotide, an effective treatment for acromegaly, induces gall bladder stones in 13-60% of patients. <s1> because knowledge of stone composition is essential for studies of their pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention, this was investigated by direct and indirect methods in 14 octreotide treated acromegalic patients with gall stones. <s2> chemical analysis of gall stones retrieved at cholecystectomy from two patients, showed that they contained 71% and 87% cholesterol by weight. <s3> in the remaining 12 patients, localised computed tomography of the gall bladder showed that eight had stones with maximum attenuation scores of < 100 hounsfield units (values of < 100 hu predict cholesterol rich, dissolvable stones). <s4> gall bladder bile was obtained by ultrasound guided, fine needle puncture from six patients. <s5> all six patients had supersaturated bile (mean (sem) cholesterol saturation index of 1.19 (0.08) (range 1.01-1.53)) and all had abnormally rapid cholesterol microcrystal nucleation times (< 4 days (range 1-4)), whilst in four, the bile contained cholesterol microcrystals immediately after sampling. <s6> of the 12 patients considered for oral ursodeoxycholic acid (udca) treatment, two had a blocked cystic duct and were not started on udca while one was lost to follow up. <s7> after one year of treatment, five of the remaining nine patients showed either partial (n = 3) or complete (n = 2) gall stone dissolution, suggesting that their stones were cholesterol rich. <s8> this corresponds, by actuarial (life table) analysis, to a combined gall stone dissolution rate of 58.3 (15.9%). <s9> in conclusion, octreotide induced gall stones are generally small, multiple, and cholesterol rich although, in common with spontaneous gall stone disease, at presentation some patients will have a blocked cystic duct and some gall stones containing calcium.

lp+ss: The composition of myosin-II isoform switches from the A isoform to the B isoform during hematopoietic differentiation. <s0> self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells depend on asymmetric division and polarized motility processes that in other cell types are modulated by nonmuscle myosin-ii (mii) forces and matrix mechanics. <s1> here, mass spectrometry-calibrated intracellular flow cytometry of human hematopoiesis reveals miib to be a major isoform that is strongly polarized in hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors (hsc/ps) and thereby downregulated in differentiated cells via asymmetric division. <s2> miia is constitutive and activated by dephosphorylation during cytokine-triggered differentiation of cells grown on stiff, endosteum-like matrix, but not soft, marrow-like matrix. <s3> in vivo, miib is required for generation of blood, while miia is required for sustained hsc/p engraftment. <s4> reversible inhibition of both isoforms in culture with blebbistatin enriches for long-term hematopoietic multilineage reconstituting cells by 5-fold or more as assessed in vivo. <s5> megakaryocytes also become more polyploid, producing 4-fold more platelets. <s6> mii is thus a multifunctional node in polarized division and niche sensing. 
lp+ss: The cytokine receptor which regulates chemotaxis and formation of lymph nodes is involved in production of myeloperoxidase in the left atrium. <s0> we have previously shown that the integrin beta6 is neo-expressed in invasive oral squamous cell carcinoma (scc) and is correlated with oral tumor progression. <s1> however, the mechanism by which the integrin beta6 promotes oral tumor progression is not well understood. <s2> the purpose of the present study was to determine whether integrin beta6 signaling activates fyn and thus promotes oral squamous cell carcinoma progression. <s3> we analyzed the integrin beta6 signaling complex and investigated the function of these signaling molecules in oral scc cells. <s4> we found that, upon ligation of the integrin beta6 with fibronectin, beta6 complexed with fyn and activated it. <s5> the activation of fyn recruited and activated focal adhesion kinase to this complex. <s6> this complex was necessary to activate shc and to couple beta6 signaling to the raf-erk/mapk pathway. <s7> this pathway transcriptionally activated the matrix metalloproteinase-3 gene and promoted oral scc cell proliferation and experimental metastasis in vivo. <s8> these findings indicate that integrin beta6 signaling activates fyn and thus promotes oral cancer progression.

lp+ss: The density of cytokine receptor bearing cells has no effect on the distance over which cytokines act. <s0> the genomic rna of an alphavirus encodes four different nonstructural proteins, nsp1, nsp2, nsp3, and nsp4. <s1> the polyprotein p123 is produced when translation terminates at an opal termination codon between nsp3 and nsp4. <s2> the polyprotein p1234 is produced when translational readthrough occurs or when the opal termination codon has been replaced by a sense codon in the alphavirus genome. <s3> evolutionary pressures appear to have maintained genomic sequences encoding both a stop codon (opal) and an open reading frame (arginine) as a general feature of the o'nyong-nyong virus (onnv) genome, indicating that both are required at some point. <s4> alternate replication of onnvs in both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts may determine predominance of a particular codon at this locus in the viral quasispecies. <s5> however, no systematic study has previously tested this hypothesis in whole animals. <s6> we report here the results of the first study to investigate in a natural mosquito host the functional significance of the opal stop codon in an alphavirus genome. <s7> we used a full-length cdna clone of onnv to construct a series of mutants in which the arginine between nsp3 and nsp4 was replaced with an opal, ochre, or amber stop codon. <s8> the presence of an opal stop codon upstream of nsp4 nearly doubled (75.5%) the infectivity of onnv over that of virus possessing a codon for the amino acid arginine at the corresponding position (39.8%). <s9> although the frequency with which the opal virus disseminated from the mosquito midgut did not differ significantly from that of the arginine virus on days 8 and 10, dissemination did began earlier in mosquitoes infected with the opal virus. <s10> although a clear fitness advantage is provided to onnv by the presence of an opal codon between nsp3 and nsp4 in anopheles gambiae, sequence analysis of onnv rna extracted from mosquito bodies and heads indicated codon usage at this position corresponded with that of the virus administered in the blood meal. <s11> these results suggest that while selection of onnv variants is occurring, de novo mutation at the position between nsp3 and nsp4 does not readily occur in the mosquito. <s12> taken together, these results suggest that the primary fitness advantage provided to onnv by the presence of an opal codon between nsp3 and nsp4 is related to mosquito infectivity. 
lp+ss: The density of cytokine receptor bearing cells has no effect on the distance over which cytokines act. <s0> rac and rho gtpases function as critical regulators of actin cytoskeleton remodelling during cell spreading and migration. <s1> here we demonstrate that rac-mediated reactive oxygen species (ros) production results in the downregulation of rho activity. <s2> the redox-dependent decrease in rho activity is required for rac-induced formation of membrane ruffles and integrin-mediated cell spreading. <s3> the pathway linking generation of ros to downregulation of rho involves inhibition of the low-molecular-weight protein tyrosine phosphatase (lmw-ptp) and then an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of its target, p190rho-gap. <s4> our findings define a novel mechanism for the coupling of changes in cellular redox state to the control of actin cytoskeleton rearrangements by rho gtpases. 
lp+ss: The deregulated and prolonged activation of monocytes has deleterious effects in chronic infectious conditions. <s0> although myeloid cell activation is requisite for an optimal innate immune response, this process must be tightly controlled to prevent collateral host tissue damage. <s1> kruppel-like factor 2 (klf2) is a potent regulator of myeloid cell proinflammatory activation. <s2> as an approximately 30% to 50% reduction in klf2 levels has been observed in human subjects with acute or chronic inflammatory disorders, we studied the biological response to inflammation in klf2(+/-) mice. <s3> herein, we show that partial deficiency of klf2 modulates the in vivo response to acute (sepsis) and subacute (skin) inflammatory challenge. <s4> mechanistically, we link the anti-inflammatory effects of klf2 to the inhibition of nf-κb transcriptional activity. <s5> collectively, the observations provide biologically relevant insights into klf2-mediated modulation of these inflammatory processes that could potentially be manipulated for therapeutic gain. 
lp+ss: The deregulated and prolonged activation of monocytes has deleterious effects in chronic infectious conditions. <s0> precise control of myeloid cell activation is required for optimal host defense. <s1> however, this activation process must be under exquisite control to prevent uncontrolled inflammation. <s2> herein, we identify the kruppel-like transcription factor 2 (klf2) as a potent regulator of myeloid cell activation in vivo. <s3> exposure of myeloid cells to hypoxia and/or bacterial products reduced klf2 expression while inducing hypoxia inducible factor-1α (hif-1α), findings that were recapitulated in human septic patients. <s4> myeloid klf2 was found to be a potent inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappab (nf-κb)-dependent hif-1α transcription and, consequently, a critical determinant of outcome in models of polymicrobial infection and endotoxemia. <s5> collectively, these observations identify klf2 as a tonic repressor of myeloid cell activation in vivo and an essential regulator of the innate immune system. 
lp+ss: The effect of Lipopolysaccharides on kidney barrier function is dependent on inflammation levels. <s0> podocyte dysfunction, represented by foot process effacement and proteinuria, is often the starting point for progressive kidney disease. <s1> therapies aimed at the cellular level of the disease are currently not available. <s2> here we show that induction of urokinase receptor (upar) signaling in podocytes leads to foot process effacement and urinary protein loss via a mechanism that includes lipid-dependent activation of αvβ3 integrin. <s3> mice lacking upar (plaur−/−) are protected from lipopolysaccharide (lps)-mediated proteinuria but develop disease after expression of a constitutively active β3 integrin. <s4> gene transfer studies reveal a prerequisite for upar expression in podocytes, but not in endothelial cells, for the development of lps-mediated proteinuria. <s5> mechanistically, upar is required to activate αvβ3 integrin in podocytes, promoting cell motility and activation of the small gtpases cdc42 and rac1. <s6> blockade of αvβ3 integrin reduces podocyte motility in vitro and lowers proteinuria in mice. <s7> our findings show a physiological role for upar signaling in the regulation of kidney permeability. 
lp+ss: The effect of Lipopolysaccharides on kidney barrier function is dependent on inflammation levels. <s0> aberrant gene silencing accompanied by dna methylation is associated with neoplastic progression in many tumors that also show global loss of dna methylation. <s1> using conditional inactivation of de novo methyltransferase dnmt3b in apc(min/+) mice, we demonstrate that the loss of dnmt3b has no impact on microadenoma formation, which is considered the earliest stage of intestinal tumor formation. <s2> nevertheless, we observed a significant decrease in the formation of macroscopic colonic adenomas. <s3> interestingly, many large adenomas showed regions with dnmt3b inactivation, indicating that dnmt3b is required for initial outgrowth of macroscopic adenomas but is not required for their maintenance. <s4> these results support a role for dnmt3b in the transition stage between microadenoma formation and macroscopic colonic tumor growth and further suggest that dnmt3b, and by extension de novo methylation, is not required for maintaining tumor growth after this transition stage has occurred. 
lp+ss: The effect of Lipopolysaccharides on kidney barrier function is dependent on inflammation levels. <s0> background p2y12 inhibitor switching has appeared in clinical practice as a consequence of prasugrel and ticagrelor availability, apart from clopidogrel, for use in patients with acute coronary syndrome (acs) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (pci).  <s1> methods in the context of the greek antiplatelet registry (grape) we assessed the prevalence, predictive factors and short-term outcome of in-hospital p2y12 inhibitor switching in 1794 acs patients undergoing pci.  <s2> results switching occurred in 636 (35.5%) patients of which in the form of clopidogrel to a novel agent, novel agent to clopidogrel and between prasugrel and ticagrelor in 574 (90.4%), 34 (5.3%) and 27 (4.3%) patients, respectively. <s3> presentation to non pci-capable hospital, bivalirudin use, age ≥75 years (inverse predictor), and regional trends emerged as predictive factors of switching to a novel agent. <s4> at combined in-hospital and one-month follow-up, propensity matched pairs analysis showed no differences in major adverse cardiovascular (mace) or bleeding events between switching from clopidogrel to a novel agent vs novel agent constant administration. <s5> more bleeding academic research consortium type 1, type 2 and any type events and fewer mace were seen when switching from clopidogrel to a novel agent vs only clopidogrel administration (23.7%, 3.8%, 30.6%, 1.2% vs 8.9%, 1.2%, 12.0%, 3.8% with p < .001, p = .03, p < .001 and p = .03 respectively).  <s6> conclusions in a real-life experience with contemporary antiplatelet treatment in acs patients undergoing pci, in-hospital switching represents common clinical practice. <s7> clinical factors and regional practice differences seem to affect this strategy's choice, while switching to a novel agent may be associated with higher risk of bleeding. 
lp+ss: The generation of reactive oxygen species by activated oncogenes contributes to the increased genomic instability of leukaemia cells. <s0> the oncogenic bcr/abl tyrosine kinase induces constitutive dna damage in philadelphia chromosome (ph)-positive leukemia cells. <s1> we find that bcr/abl-induced reactive oxygen species (ross) cause chronic oxidative dna damage resulting in double-strand breaks (dsbs) in s and g(2)/m cell cycle phases. <s2> these lesions are repaired by bcr/abl-stimulated homologous recombination repair (hrr) and nonhomologous end-joining (nhej) mechanisms. <s3> a high mutation rate is detected in hrr products in bcr/abl-positive cells, but not in the normal counterparts. <s4> in addition, large deletions are found in nhej products exclusively in bcr/abl cells. <s5> we propose that the following series of events may contribute to genomic instability of ph-positive leukemias: bcr/abl -> ross -> oxidative dna damage -> dsbs in proliferating cells -> unfaithful hrr and nhej repair.

lp+ss: The mean suicide rate in women is lower after miscarriage than live birth. <s0> the bulk of atp consumed by various cellular processes in higher eukaryotes is normally produced by five multimeric protein complexes (i-v) embedded within the inner mitochondrial membrane, in a process known as oxidative phosphorylation (oxphos). <s1> maintenance of energy homeostasis under most physiological conditions is therefore contingent upon the ability of oxphos to meet cellular changes in bioenergetic demand, with a chronic failure to do so being a frequent cause of human disease. <s2> with the exception of complex ii, the structural subunits of oxphos complexes are encoded by both the nuclear and the mitochondrial genomes. <s3> the physical separation of the two genomes necessitates that the expression of the 13 mitochondrially encoded polypeptides be co-ordinated with that of relevant nuclear-encoded partners in order to assemble functional holoenzyme complexes. <s4> complex biogenesis is a highly ordered process, and several nuclear-encoded factors that function at distinct stages in the assembly of individual oxphos complexes have been identified.

lp+ss: The morphology change from large white adipocytes to small brown adipocytes is a sign of decreased energy expenditure potential in white adipose tissue. <s0> small-angle x-ray scattering for macromolecules in solution is now widely used in structural biology to complement high-resolution structure determination obtained by x-ray crystallography or nmr. <s1> in the context of third-generation synchrotron sources, this increasing interest leads to developments in sample environments and automation. <s2> the presence of an online purification system is justified by the need for sample monodispersity. <s3> a combined system including an auto-sampler robot and online high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) has been developed and optimized at the swing beamline of synchrotron soleil (gif-sur-yvette, france). <s4> in the sample changer mode, a few microlitres of sample can be injected between two air bubbles and circulated at a controlled speed of typically 40 µl min−1. <s5> a maximum of 14 samples per hour could be measured in this mode by remote controlling the sample injections. <s6> in the hplc mode, an initially polydisperse sample can be separated into each of its components before immediate data acquisition. <s7> the sample cell is thermostated, and offers a visualization control and online uv–vis absorption monitoring. 
lp+ss: The morphology change from large white adipocytes to small brown adipocytes is a sign of increased energy expenditure potential in white adipose tissue. <s0> uncoupling protein 1 (ucp1) is highly expressed in brown adipose tissue, where it generates heat by uncoupling electron transport from atp production. <s1> ucp1 is also found outside classical brown adipose tissue depots, in adipocytes that are termed 'brite' (brown-in-white) or 'beige'. <s2> in humans, the presence of brite or beige (brite/beige) adipocytes is correlated with a lean, metabolically healthy phenotype, but whether a causal relationship exists is not clear. <s3> here we report that human brite/beige adipocyte progenitors proliferate in response to pro-angiogenic factors, in association with expanding capillary networks. <s4> adipocytes formed from these progenitors transform in response to adenylate cyclase activation from being ucp1 negative to being ucp1 positive, which is a defining feature of the beige/brite phenotype, while displaying uncoupled respiration. <s5> when implanted into normal chow-fed, or into high-fat diet (hfd)-fed, glucose-intolerant nod-scid il2rg(null) (nsg) mice, brite/beige adipocytes activated in vitro enhance systemic glucose tolerance. <s6> these adipocytes express neuroendocrine and secreted factors, including the pro-protein convertase pcsk1, which is strongly associated with human obesity. <s7> pro-angiogenic conditions therefore drive the proliferation of human beige/brite adipocyte progenitors, and activated beige/brite adipocytes can affect systemic glucose homeostasis, potentially through a neuroendocrine mechanism.

lp+ss: The most prevalent adverse events to Semaglutide are gastrointestinal. <s0> dna damage encountered by dna replication forks poses risks of genome destabilization, a precursor to carcinogenesis. <s1> damage checkpoint systems cause cell cycle arrest, promote repair and induce programed cell death when damage is severe. <s2> checkpoints are critical parts of the dna damage response network that act to suppress cancer. <s3> dna damage and perturbation of replication machinery causes replication stress, characterized by accumulation of single-stranded dna bound by replication protein a (rpa), which triggers activation of ataxia telangiectasia and rad3 related (atr) and phosphorylation of the rpa32, subunit of rpa, leading to chk1 activation and arrest. <s4> dna-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (dna-pkcs) [a kinase related to ataxia telangiectasia mutated (atm) and atr] has well characterized roles in dna double-strand break repair, but poorly understood roles in replication stress-induced rpa phosphorylation. <s5> we show that dna-pkcs mutant cells fail to arrest replication following stress, and mutations in rpa32 phosphorylation sites targeted by dna-pkcs increase the proportion of cells in mitosis, impair atr signaling to chk1 and confer a g2/m arrest defect. <s6> inhibition of atr and dna-pk (but not atm), mimic the defects observed in cells expressing mutant rpa32. <s7> cells expressing mutant rpa32 or dna-pkcs show sustained h2ax phosphorylation in response to replication stress that persists in cells entering mitosis, indicating inappropriate mitotic entry with unrepaired damage. 
lp+ss: The most prevalent adverse events to Semaglutide are gastrointestinal. <s0> a major question is whether genes encoded on the sex chromosomes act directly in non-gonadal tissues to cause sex differences in development or function, or whether all sex differences in somatic tissues are induced by gonadal secretions. <s1> as part of this question we asked whether mouse x-y homologous gene pairs are expressed in brain in a sex-specific fashion. <s2> using rt-pcr and northern blot analysis, we assessed mrna expression in brain of eight y-linked genes as well as their x-linked homologues, at three ages: 13.5 days post coitum, the day of birth (p1) and adult. <s3> transcripts of six y genes were expressed at one or more ages: usp9y, ube1y, smcy, eif2s3y, uty and dby. <s4> their expression also occurred in xy female brain, and therefore does not require testicular secretions. <s5> six x-linked homologues (usp9x, ube1x, smcx, eif2s3x, utx and dbx) were also expressed in brain, and in adulthood all of these transcripts were expressed at significantly higher levels in brains of females than in brains of males, irrespective of their x-inactivation status. <s6> for five of these gene pairs, the expression of the y-linked homologue in males was not sufficient to compensate for the female bias in x gene expression. <s7> three x-y gene pairs, usp9x/y, ube1x/y and eif2s3x/y, appeared to be differentially regulated (expressed in brain in a different age- or tissue-dependent pattern), and hence may not be functionally equivalent. <s8> these sex differences in x-y gene expression suggest several mechanisms by which these genes may participate in sex differences in brain development and function. 
lp+ss: The myocardial cell lineage originally develops from cardiac progenitors of exclusively endodermal origin. <s0> the functional heart is comprised of distinct mesoderm-derived lineages including cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells. <s1> studies in the mouse embryo and the mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation model have provided evidence indicating that these three lineages develop from a common flk-1+ (kinase insert domain protein receptor, also known as kdr) cardiovascular progenitor that represents one of the earliest stages in mesoderm specification to the cardiovascular lineages. <s2> to determine whether a comparable progenitor is present during human cardiogenesis, we analysed the development of the cardiovascular lineages in human embryonic stem cell differentiation cultures. <s3> here we show that after induction with combinations of activin a, bone morphogenetic protein 4 (bmp4), basic fibroblast growth factor (bfgf, also known as fgf2), vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf, also known as vegfa) and dickkopf homolog 1 (dkk1) in serum-free media, human embryonic-stem-cell-derived embryoid bodies generate a kdrlow/c-kit(cd117)neg population that displays cardiac, endothelial and vascular smooth muscle potential in vitro and, after transplantation, in vivo. <s4> when plated in monolayer cultures, these kdrlow/c-kitneg cells differentiate to generate populations consisting of greater than 50% contracting cardiomyocytes. <s5> populations derived from the kdrlow/c-kitneg fraction give rise to colonies that contain all three lineages when plated in methylcellulose cultures. <s6> results from limiting dilution studies and cell-mixing experiments support the interpretation that these colonies are clones, indicating that they develop from a cardiovascular colony-forming cell. <s7> together, these findings identify a human cardiovascular progenitor that defines one of the earliest stages of human cardiac development.

lp+ss: The myocardial cell lineage originally develops from cardiac progenitors of exclusively endodermal origin. <s0> research on the human microbiome has established that commensal and pathogenic bacteria can influence obesity, cancer, and autoimmunity through mechanisms mostly unknown. <s1> we found that a component of bacterial biofilms, the amyloid protein curli, irreversibly formed fibers with bacterial dna during biofilm formation. <s2> this interaction accelerated amyloid polymerization and created potent immunogenic complexes that activated immune cells, including dendritic cells, to produce cytokines such as type i interferons, which are pathogenic in systemic lupus erythematosus (sle). <s3> when given systemically, curli-dna composites triggered immune activation and production of autoantibodies in lupus-prone and wild-type mice. <s4> we also found that the infection of lupus-prone mice with curli-producing bacteria triggered higher autoantibody titers compared to curli-deficient bacteria. <s5> these data provide a mechanism by which the microbiome and biofilm-producing enteric infections may contribute to the progression of sle and point to a potential molecular target for treatment of autoimmunity. 
lp+ss: The myocardial cell lineage originally develops from cardiac progenitors of exclusively endodermal origin. <s0> despite being surrounded by diverse nutrients, mammalian cells preferentially metabolize glucose and free amino acids. <s1> recently, ras-induced macropinocytosis of extracellular proteins was shown to reduce a transformed cell's dependence on extracellular glutamine. <s2> here, we demonstrate that protein macropinocytosis can also serve as an essential amino acid source. <s3> lysosomal degradation of extracellular proteins can sustain cell survival and induce activation of mtorc1 but fails to elicit significant cell accumulation. <s4> unlike its growth-promoting activity under amino-acid-replete conditions, we discovered that mtorc1 activation suppresses proliferation when cells rely on extracellular proteins as an amino acid source. <s5> inhibiting mtorc1 results in increased catabolism of endocytosed proteins and enhances cell proliferation during nutrient-depleted conditions in vitro and within vascularly compromised tumors in vivo. <s6> thus, by preventing nutritional consumption of extracellular proteins, mtorc1 couples growth to availability of free amino acids. <s7> these results may have important implications for the use of mtor inhibitors as therapeutics.

lp+ss: The risk of female prisoners harming themselves is ten times that of male prisoners. <s0> background studies have shown that women use more health care services than men. <s1> we used important independent variables, such as patient sociodemographics and health status, to investigate gender differences in the use and costs of these services.  <s2> methods new adult patients (n = 509) were randomly assigned to primary care physicians at a university medical center. <s3> their use of health care services and associated charges were monitored for 1 year of care. <s4> self-reported health status was measured using the medical outcomes study short form-36 (sf-36). <s5> we controlled for health status, sociodemographic information, and primary care physician specialty in the statistical analyses.  <s6> results women had significantly lower self-reported health status and lower mean education and income than men. <s7> women had a significantly higher mean number of visits to their primary care clinic and diagnostic services than men. <s8> mean charges for primary care, specialty care, emergency treatment, diagnostic services, and annual total charges were all significantly higher for women than men; however, there were no differences for mean hospitalizations or hospital charges. <s9> after controlling for health status, sociodemographics, and clinic assignment, women still had higher medical charges for all categories of charges except hospitalizations.  <s10> conclusions women have higher medical care service utilization and higher associated charges than men. <s11> although the appropriateness of these differences was not determined, these findings have implications for health care. 
lp+ss: The tip of the inner tube of the toxic type VI secretion system (T6SS) antibacterial effector in Escherichia coli (E. coli) is decorated with VgrG and PAAR proteins. <s0> the bacterial type vi secretion system (t6ss) is an organelle that is structurally and mechanistically analogous to an intracellular membrane-attached contractile phage tail. <s1> recent studies determined that a rapid conformational change in the structure of a sheath protein complex propels t6ss spike and tube components along with antibacterial and antieukaryotic effectors out of predatory t6ss(+) cells and into prey cells. <s2> the contracted organelle is then recycled in an atp-dependent process. <s3> t6ss is regulated at transcriptional and posttranslational levels, the latter involving detection of membrane perturbation in some species. <s4> in addition to directly targeting eukaryotic cells, the t6ss can also target other bacteria coinfecting a mammalian host, highlighting the importance of the t6ss not only for bacterial survival in environmental ecosystems, but also in the context of infection and disease. <s5> this review highlights these and other advances in our understanding of the structure, mechanical function, assembly, and regulation of the t6ss.

lp+ss: Therapeutics receiving accelerated approval encounter a lower frequency of post-marketing safety events <s0> macropinocytosis is a highly conserved endocytic process by which extracellular fluid and its contents are internalized into cells through large, heterogeneous vesicles known as macropinosomes. <s1> oncogenic ras proteins have been shown to stimulate macropinocytosis but the functional contribution of this uptake mechanism to the transformed phenotype remains unknown. <s2> here we show that ras-transformed cells use macropinocytosis to transport extracellular protein into the cell. <s3> the internalized protein undergoes proteolytic degradation, yielding amino acids including glutamine that can enter central carbon metabolism. <s4> accordingly, the dependence of ras-transformed cells on free extracellular glutamine for growth can be suppressed by the macropinocytic uptake of protein. <s5> consistent with macropinocytosis representing an important route of nutrient uptake in tumours, its pharmacological inhibition compromises the growth of ras-transformed pancreatic tumour xenografts. <s6> these results identify macropinocytosis as a mechanism by which cancer cells support their unique metabolic needs and point to the possible exploitation of this process in the design of anticancer therapies. 
lp+ss: Therapeutics receiving accelerated approval encounter a lower frequency of post-marketing safety events <s0> robust multiarray analysis (rma) is the most widely used preprocessing algorithm for affymetrix and nimblegen gene expression microarrays. <s1> rma performs background correction, normalization, and summarization in a modular way. <s2> the last 2 steps require multiple arrays to be analyzed simultaneously. <s3> the ability to borrow information across samples provides rma various advantages. <s4> for example, the summarization step fits a parametric model that accounts for probe effects, assumed to be fixed across arrays, and improves outlier detection. <s5> residuals, obtained from the fitted model, permit the creation of useful quality metrics. <s6> however, the dependence on multiple arrays has 2 drawbacks: (1) rma cannot be used in clinical settings where samples must be processed individually or in small batches and (2) data sets preprocessed separately are not comparable. <s7> we propose a preprocessing algorithm, frozen rma (frma), which allows one to analyze microarrays individually or in small batches and then combine the data for analysis. <s8> this is accomplished by utilizing information from the large publicly available microarray databases. <s9> in particular, estimates of probe-specific effects and variances are precomputed and frozen. <s10> then, with new data sets, these are used in concert with information from the new arrays to normalize and summarize the data. <s11> we find that frma is comparable to rma when the data are analyzed as a single batch and outperforms rma when analyzing multiple batches. <s12> the methods described here are implemented in the r package frma and are currently available for download from the software section of http://rafalab.jhsph.edu.

lp+ss: There is a relation between Erythromycin use and hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. <s0> a characteristic feature of anaplastic large cell lymphoma is the significant repression of the t-cell expression program despite its t-cell origin. <s1> the reasons for this down-regulation of t-cell phenotype are still unknown. <s2> to elucidate whether epigenetic mechanisms are responsible for the loss of the t-cell phenotype, we treated anaplastic large cell lymphoma and t-cell lymphoma/leukemia cell lines (n=4, each) with epigenetic modifiers to evoke dna demethylation and histone acetylation. <s3> global gene expression data from treated and untreated cell lines were generated and selected, and differentially expressed genes were evaluated by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. <s4> additionally, histone h3 lysine 27 trimethylation was analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. <s5> combined dna demethylation and histone acetylation of anaplastic large cell lymphoma cells was not able to reconstitute their t-cell phenotype. <s6> instead, the same treatment induced in t cells: (i) an up-regulation of anaplastic large cell lymphoma-characteristic genes (e.g. id2, lgals1, c-jun), and (ii) an almost complete extinction of their t-cell phenotype including cd3, lck and zap70. <s7> in addition, suppressive trimethylation of histone h3 lysine 27 of important t-cell transcription factor genes (gata3, lef1, tcf1) was present in anaplastic large cell lymphoma cells, which is in line with their absence in primary tumor specimens as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. <s8> our data suggest that epigenetically activated suppressors (e.g. id2) contribute to the down-regulation of the t-cell expression program in anaplastic large cell lymphoma, which is maintained by trimethylation of histone h3 lysine 27.

lp+ss: There is no known interaction between Pioneer factor OCT3/4 and major chromatin remodeling factors. <s0> using the princeton school district family study cohort, our specific aim was to estimate the prevalence of suspected familial ponderosity and leanness, to provide empirical risk estimates for the proportion of probands' first-degree relatives who were similarly affected, and to estimate the contributions of diseases, drugs and caloric intake to relative obesity and leanness. <s1> we studied 379 probands, 125 whites and 52 blacks from a random recall group, 147 whites and 55 blacks from a hyperlipidemic recall group. <s2> suspected familial obesity and leanness were arbitrarily identified in those kindreds with at least two first-degree relatives in the same quetelet index decile as the proband, top or bottom respectively. <s3> suspected familial obesity was observed in 2.4 percent and 6 percent respectively of random and hyperlipidemic recall group whites. <s4> suspected familial leanness was identified in 2.4 percent and 1.4 percent of random and hyperlipidemic recall whites and in 3.8 percent of randomly recalled blacks. <s5> approximately twice as many as expected white first-degree relatives of top quetelet index decile probands themselves had top decile quetelet indices; approximately three times as many as expected first-degree relatives of bottom decile quetelet index probands themselves had bottom decile quetelet indices. <s6> nineteen percent and 31 percent of top decile quetelet index white probands from random and hyperlipidemic recall groups came from families where at least two other first-degree relatives were similarly obese; 18 percent and 20 percent of white random and hyperlipidemic recall group probands with bottom decile quetelet indices had suspected familial leanness. <s7> nearly all subjects with familial obesity or leanness had no overt metabolic or pharmacological explanations for their body habitus. <s8> within-family clustering of hypertension was common in kindreds with suspected familial obesity and was absent in kindreds with suspected familial leanness. <s9> marked within-family clustering of both obesity and leanness is useful diagnostically; therapeutic intervention to reduce obesity, to be most effective, should be family-wide in the many kindreds which share familial obesity. 
lp+ss: There is no known interaction between Pioneer factor OCT3/4 and major chromatin remodeling factors. <s0> the autoimmune regulator (aire) plays a critical role in central tolerance by promoting the display of tissue-specific antigens in the thymus. <s1> to study the influence of aire on thymic selection in a physiological setting, we used tetramer reagents to detect autoreactive t cells specific for the aire-dependent tissue-specific antigen interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (irbp), in the polyclonal repertoire. <s2> two class ii tetramer reagents were designed to identify t cells specific for two different peptide epitopes of irbp. <s3> analyses of the polyclonal t-cell repertoire showed a high frequency of activated t cells specific for both irbp tetramers in aire(-/-) mice, but not in aire(+/+) mice. <s4> surprisingly, although one tetramer-binding t-cell population was efficiently deleted in the thymus in an aire-dependent manner, the second tetramer-binding population was not deleted and could be detected in both the aire(-/-) and aire(+/+) t-cell repertoires. <s5> we found that aire-dependent thymic deletion of irbp-specific t cells relies on intercellular transfer of irbp between thymic stroma and bone marrow-derived antigen-presenting cells. <s6> furthermore, our data suggest that aire-mediated deletion relies not only on thymic expression of irbp, but also on proper antigen processing and presentation of irbp by thymic antigen-presenting cells.

lp+ss: There is no relation between Erythromycin use and hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. <s0> background ketamine, as an anesthetic agent, has an anti-inflammatory effect. <s1> in the present study, we investigated whether ketamine inhibits release of high mobility group box 1 (hmgb1), a late-phase cytokine of sepsis, in lipopolysaccharide (lps)-stimulated macrophages through heme oxygenase-1 (ho-1) induction.  <s2> methods macrophages were preincubated with various concentrations of ketamine and then treated with lps (1 μg/ml). <s3> the cell culture supernatants were collected to measure inflammatory mediators (hmgb1, nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin 1β) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. <s4> moreover, ho-1 protein expression, the phosphorylation and degradation of iκb-α, and the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor e2-related factor 2 and nuclear factor κb (nf-κb) p65 were tested by western blot analysis. <s5> in addition, to further identify the role of ho-1 in this process, tin protoporphyrin (snpp), an ho-1 inhibitor, was used.  <s6> results ketamine treatment dose-dependently attenuated the increased levels of proinflammatory mediators (hmgb1, nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor α, and interleukin 1β) and increased the ho-1 protein expression in lps-activated macrophages. <s7> furthermore, ketamine suppressed the phosphorylation and degradation of iκb-α as well as the lps-stimulated nuclear translocation of nf-κb p65 in macrophages. <s8> in addition, the present study also demonstrated that ketamine induced ho-1 expression through the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor e2-related factor 2 in macrophages. <s9> the effects of ketamine on lps-induced proinflammatory cytokines production were partially reversed by the ho inhibitor tin protoporphyrin (snpp).  <s10> conclusion ketamine inhibits the release of hmgb1 in lps-stimulated macrophages, and this effect is at least partly mediated by the activation of the nrf2/ho-1 pathway and nf-κb suppression.

lp+ss: There was an estimated 30 million cases of pneumonia in young children worldwide in 2010. <s0> the er-associated degradation (erad) pathway serves as an important cellular safeguard by directing incorrectly folded and unassembled proteins from the er to the proteasome. <s1> still, however, little is known about the components mediating erad of membrane proteins. <s2> here we show that the evolutionary conserved rhomboid family protein rhbdl4 is a ubiquitin-dependent er-resident intramembrane protease that is upregulated upon er stress. <s3> rhbdl4 cleaves single-spanning and polytopic membrane proteins with unstable transmembrane helices, leading to their degradation by the canonical erad machinery. <s4> rhbdl4 specifically binds the aaa+-atpase p97, suggesting that proteolytic processing and dislocation into the cytosol are functionally linked. <s5> the phylogenetic relationship between rhomboids and the erad factor derlin suggests that substrates for intramembrane proteolysis and protein dislocation are recruited by a shared mechanism.

lp+ss: Tirasemtiv targets cardiac muscle. <s0> the mechanisms by which a primary tumor affects a selected distant organ before tumor cell arrival remain to be elucidated. <s1> this report shows that gr-1+cd11b+ cells are significantly increased in lungs of mice bearing mammary adenocarcinomas before tumor cell arrival. <s2> in the premetastatic lungs, these immature myeloid cells significantly decrease ifn-gamma production and increase proinflammatory cytokines. <s3> in addition, they produce large quantities of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (mmp9) and promote vascular remodeling. <s4> deletion of mmp9 normalizes aberrant vasculature in the premetastatic lung and diminishes lung metastasis. <s5> the production and activity of mmp9 is selectively restricted to lungs and organs with a large number of gr-1+cd11b+ cells. <s6> our work reveals a novel protumor mechanism for gr-1+cd11b+ cells that changes the premetastatic lung into an inflammatory and proliferative environment, diminishes immune protection, and promotes metastasis through aberrant vasculature formation. <s7> thus, inhibition of gr-1+cd11b+ cells could normalize the premetastatic lung environment, improve host immunosurveillance, and inhibit tumor metastasis. 
lp+ss: Tirasemtiv targets fast-twitch muscle. <s0> limited neural input results in muscle weakness in neuromuscular disease because of a reduction in the density of muscle innervation, the rate of neuromuscular junction activation or the efficiency of synaptic transmission. <s1> we developed a small-molecule fast-skeletal-troponin activator, ck-2017357, as a means to increase muscle strength by amplifying the response of muscle when neural input is otherwise diminished secondary to neuromuscular disease. <s2> binding selectively to the fast-skeletal-troponin complex, ck-2017357 slows the rate of calcium release from troponin c and sensitizes muscle to calcium. <s3> as a consequence, the force-calcium relationship of muscle fibers shifts leftwards, as does the force-frequency relationship of a nerve-muscle pair, so that ck-2017357 increases the production of muscle force in situ at sub-maximal nerve stimulation rates. <s4> notably, we show that sensitization of the fast-skeletal-troponin complex to calcium improves muscle force and grip strength immediately after administration of single doses of ck-2017357 in a model of the neuromuscular disease myasthenia gravis. <s5> troponin activation may provide a new therapeutic approach to improve physical activity in diseases where neuromuscular function is compromised.

lp+ss: Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of human MDS. <s0> myelodysplastic syndromes (mds) are age-dependent stem cell malignancies that share biological features of activated adaptive immune response and ineffective hematopoiesis. <s1> here we report that myeloid-derived suppressor cells (mdsc), which are classically linked to immunosuppression, inflammation, and cancer, were markedly expanded in the bone marrow of mds patients and played a pathogenetic role in the development of ineffective hematopoiesis. <s2> these clonally distinct mdsc overproduce hematopoietic suppressive cytokines and function as potent apoptotic effectors targeting autologous hematopoietic progenitors. <s3> using multiple transfected cell models, we found that mdsc expansion is driven by the interaction of the proinflammatory molecule s100a9 with cd33. <s4> these 2 proteins formed a functional ligand/receptor pair that recruited components to cd33's immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (itim), inducing secretion of the suppressive cytokines il-10 and tgf-β by immature myeloid cells. <s5> s100a9 transgenic mice displayed bone marrow accumulation of mdsc accompanied by development of progressive multilineage cytopenias and cytological dysplasia. <s6> importantly, early forced maturation of mdsc by either all-trans-retinoic acid treatment or active immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif–bearing (itam-bearing) adapter protein (dap12) interruption of cd33 signaling rescued the hematologic phenotype. <s7> these findings indicate that primary bone marrow expansion of mdsc driven by the s100a9/cd33 pathway perturbs hematopoiesis and contributes to the development of mds. 
lp+ss: Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of human MDS. <s0> despite genetic heterogeneity, myelodysplastic syndromes (mdss) share features of cytological dysplasia and ineffective hematopoiesis. <s1> we report that a hallmark of mdss is activation of the nlrp3 inflammasome, which drives clonal expansion and pyroptotic cell death. <s2> independent of genotype, mds hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (hspcs) overexpress inflammasome proteins and manifest activated nlrp3 complexes that direct activation of caspase-1, generation of interleukin-1β (il-1β) and il-18, and pyroptotic cell death. <s3> mechanistically, pyroptosis is triggered by the alarmin s100a9 that is found in excess in mds hspcs and bone marrow plasma. <s4> further, like somatic gene mutations, s100a9-induced signaling activates nadph oxidase (nox), increasing levels of reactive oxygen species (ros) that initiate cation influx, cell swelling, and β-catenin activation. <s5> notably, knockdown of nlrp3 or caspase-1, neutralization of s100a9, and pharmacologic inhibition of nlrp3 or nox suppress pyroptosis, ros generation, and nuclear β-catenin in mdss and are sufficient to restore effective hematopoiesis. <s6> thus, alarmins and founder gene mutations in mdss license a common redox-sensitive inflammasome circuit, which suggests new avenues for therapeutic intervention. 
lp+ss: Tonic signaling from the scFv induces constitutive stimulation. <s0> chimeric antigen receptors (cars) targeting cd19 have mediated dramatic antitumor responses in hematologic malignancies, but tumor regression has rarely occurred using cars targeting other antigens. <s1> it remains unknown whether the impressive effects of cd19 cars relate to greater susceptibility of hematologic malignancies to car therapies, or superior functionality of the cd19 car itself. <s2> we show that tonic car cd3-ζ phosphorylation, triggered by antigen-independent clustering of car single-chain variable fragments, can induce early exhaustion of car t cells that limits antitumor efficacy. <s3> such activation is present to varying degrees in all cars studied, except the highly effective cd19 car. <s4> we further determine that cd28 costimulation augments, whereas 4-1bb costimulation reduces, exhaustion induced by persistent car signaling. <s5> our results provide biological explanations for the antitumor effects of cd19 cars and for the observations that cd19 car t cells incorporating the 4-1bb costimulatory domain are more persistent than those incorporating cd28 in clinical trials. 
lp+ss: Tonic signaling from the scFv is amplified by MyD88/CD40. <s0> loss of omi/htra2 function leads to nerve cell loss in mouse models and has been linked to neurodegeneration in parkinson's and huntington's disease. <s1> omi/htra2 is a serine protease released as a pro-apoptotic factor from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytosol. <s2> under physiological conditions, omi/htra2 is thought to be involved in protection against cellular stress, but the cytological and molecular mechanisms are not clear. <s3> omi/htra2 deficiency caused an accumulation of reactive oxygen species and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential. <s4> in omi/htra2 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts, as well as in omi/htra2 silenced human hela cells and drosophila s2r+ cells, we found elongated mitochondria by live cell imaging. <s5> electron microscopy confirmed the mitochondrial morphology alterations and showed abnormal cristae structure. <s6> examining the levels of proteins involved in mitochondrial fusion, we found a selective up-regulation of more soluble opa1 protein. <s7> complementation of knockout cells with wild-type omi/htra2 but not with the protease mutant [s306a]omi/htra2 reversed the mitochondrial elongation phenotype and opa1 alterations. <s8> finally, co-immunoprecipitation showed direct interaction of omi/htra2 with endogenous opa1. <s9> thus, we show for the first time a direct effect of loss of omi/htra2 on mitochondrial morphology and demonstrate a novel role of this mitochondrial serine protease in the modulation of opa1. <s10> our results underscore a critical role of impaired mitochondrial dynamics in neurodegenerative disorders.

lp+ss: Traditional reviews are biased in their interpretations. <s0> context early childhood introduction of nutritional habits aimed at atherosclerosis prevention is compatible with normal growth, but its effect on neurological development is unknown.  <s1> objective to analyze how parental counseling aimed at keeping children's diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol influences neurodevelopment during the first 5 years of life.  <s2> design randomized controlled trial conducted between february 1990 and november 1996.  <s3> setting outpatient clinic of a university department in turku, finland.  <s4> participants a total of 1062 seven-month-old infants and their parents, recruited at well-baby clinics between 1990 and 1992. <s5> at age 5 years, 496 children still living in the city of turku were available to participate in neurodevelopmental testing.  <s6> intervention participants were randomly assigned to receive individualized counseling aimed at limiting the child's fat intake to 30% to 35% of daily energy, with a saturated:monounsaturated:polyunsaturated fatty acid ratio of 1:1:1 and a cholesterol intake of less than 200 mg/d (n = 540) or usual health education (control group, n = 522).  <s7> main outcome measures nutrient intake, serum lipid concentrations, and neurological development at 5 years, among children in the intervention vs control groups.  <s8> results absolute and relative intakes of fat, saturated fatty acids, and cholesterol among children in the intervention group were markedly less than the respective values of control children. <s9> mean (sd) percentages of daily energy at age 5 years for the intervention vs control groups were as follows: for total fat, 30.6% (4.5%) vs 33.4% (4.4%) (p<. 001); and for saturated fat, 11.7% (2.3%) vs 14.5% (2.4%) (p<.001). <s10> mean intakes of cholesterol were 164.2 mg (60.1 mg) and 192.5 mg (71. 9 mg) (p<.001) for the intervention and control groups, respectively. <s11> serum cholesterol concentrations were continuously 3% to 5% lower in children in the intervention group than in children in the control group. <s12> at age 5 years, mean (sd) serum cholesterol concentration of the intervention group was 4.27 (0.63) mmol/l (165 [24] mg/dl) and of the control group, 4.41 (0.74) mmol/l (170 [29] mg/dl) (p =.04). <s13> neurological development of children in the intervention group was at least as good as that of children in the control group. <s14> relative risks for children in the intervention group to fail tests of speech and language skills, gross motor functioning plus perception, and visual motor skills were 0.95 (90% confidence interval [ci], 0.60-1.49), 0.95 (90% ci, 0.58-1.55), and 0.65 (90% ci, 0.39-1.08), respectively (p =.85,.86, and.16, respectively, vs control children).  <s15> conclusion our data indicate that repeated child-targeted dietary counseling of parents during the first 5 years of a child's life lessens age-associated increases in children's serum cholesterol and is compatible with normal neurological development. <s16> jama. <s17> 2000;284:993-1000 
lp+ss: Trans-acting factors, such as lncRNAs, influence mRNA translation. <s0> mammalian long intergenic noncoding rnas (lincrnas) are best known for modulating transcription. <s1> here we report a posttranscriptional function for lincrna-p21 as a modulator of translation. <s2> association of the rna-binding protein hur with lincrna-p21 favored the recruitment of let-7/ago2 to lincrna-p21, leading to lower lincrna-p21 stability. <s3> under reduced hur levels, lincrna-p21 accumulated in human cervical carcinoma hela cells, increasing its association with junb and ctnnb1 mrnas and selectively lowering their translation. <s4> with elevated hur, lincrna-p21 levels declined, which in turn derepressed junb and β-catenin translation and increased the levels of these proteins. <s5> we propose that hur controls translation of a subset of target mrnas by influencing lincrna-p21 levels. <s6> our findings uncover a role for lincrna as a posttranscriptional inhibitor of translation.

lp+ss: Transcription factor EB induces transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages infected with Staphylococcus aureus. <s0> animal host defense against infection requires the expression of defense genes at the right place and the right time. <s1> understanding such tight control of host defense requires the elucidation of the transcription factors involved. <s2> by using an unbiased approach in the model caenorhabditis elegans, we discovered that hlh-30 (known as tfeb in mammals) is a key transcription factor for host defense. <s3> hlh-30 was activated shortly after staphylococcus aureus infection, and drove the expression of close to 80% of the host response, including antimicrobial and autophagy genes that were essential for host tolerance of infection. <s4> tfeb was also rapidly activated in murine macrophages upon s. aureus infection and was required for proper transcriptional induction of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. <s5> thus, our data suggest that tfeb is a previously unappreciated, evolutionarily ancient transcription factor in the host response to infection.

lp+ss: Transcription rates in S. cerevisiae range between 0.7 and 2 kb/min. <s0> a number of proteins and drugs have been implicated in the process of transcriptional elongation by rna polymerase (pol) ii, but the factors that govern the elongation rate (nucleotide additions per min) and processivity (nucleotide additions per initiation event) in vivo are poorly understood. <s1> here, we show that a mutation in the rpb2 subunit of pol ii reduces both the elongation rate and processivity in vivo. <s2> in contrast, none of the putative elongation factors tested affect the elongation rate, although mutations in the tho complex and in spt4 significantly reduce processivity. <s3> the drugs 6-azauracil and mycophenolic acid reduce both the elongation rate and processivity, and this processivity defect is aggravated by mutations in spt4, tfiis, and ctdk-1. <s4> our results suggest that, in vivo, a reduced rate of pol ii elongation leads to premature dissociation along the chromatin template and that pol ii processivity can be uncoupled from elongation rate. 
lp+ss: Transcription rates in S. cerevisiae range between 0.7 and 2 kb/min. <s0> cells deficient in a major dna double-strand break repair pathway (nonhomologous dna end joining [nhej]) have increased spontaneous chromosome breaks; however, the source of these chromosome breaks has remained undefined. <s1> here, we show that the observed spontaneous chromosome breaks are partially suppressed by reducing the cellular oxygen tension. <s2> conversely, elevating the level of reactive oxygen species by overexpressing the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase 1 (sod1), in a transgenic mouse, increases chromosome breakage. <s3> the effect of sod1 can also be modulated by cellular oxygen tension. <s4> the elevated chromosome breakage correlates histologically with a significant increase in the amount of neuronal cell death in ku86(-/-) sod1 transgenic embryos over that seen in ku86(-/-) embryos. <s5> therefore, oxygen metabolism is a major source of the genomic instability observed in nhej-deficient cells and, presumably, in all cells.

lp+ss: Transcription rates in S. cerevisiae range between 7 and 12 kb/min. <s0> proper execution of transcriptional programs is a key requirement of gene expression regulation, demanding accurate control of timing and amplitude. <s1> how precisely the transcription machinery fulfills this task is not known. <s2> using an in situ hybridization approach that detects single mrna molecules, we measured mrna abundance and transcriptional activity within single saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. <s3> we found that expression levels for particular genes are higher than initially reported and can vary substantially among cells. <s4> however, variability for most constitutively expressed genes is unexpectedly small. <s5> combining single-transcript measurements with computational modeling indicates that low expression variation is achieved by transcribing genes using single transcription-initiation events that are clearly separated in time, rather than by transcriptional bursts. <s6> in contrast, pdr5, a gene regulated by the transcription coactivator complex saga, is expressed using transcription bursts, resulting in larger variation. <s7> these data directly demonstrate the existence of multiple expression modes used to modulate the transcriptome. 
lp+ss: Transcription rates in S. cerevisiae range between 7 and 12 kb/min. <s0> at the cellular level, development progresses through successive regulatory states, each characterized by their specific gene expression profile. <s1> however, the molecular mechanisms regulating first the priming and then maintenance of gene expression within one developmental pathway are essentially unknown. <s2> the hematopoietic system represents a powerful experimental model to address these questions and here we have focused on a regulatory circuit playing a central role in myelopoiesis: the transcription factor pu.1, its target gene colony-stimulating-factor 1 receptor (csf1r), and key upstream regulators such as runx1. <s3> we find that during ontogeny, chromatin unfolding precedes the establishment of active histone marks and the formation of stable transcription factor complexes at the pu.1 locus and we show that chromatin remodeling is mediated by the transient binding of runx1 to pu.1 cis-elements. <s4> by contrast, chromatin reorganization of csf1r requires prior expression of pu.1 together with runx1 binding. <s5> once the full hematopoietic program is established, stable transcription factor complexes and active chromatin can be maintained without runx1. <s6> our experiments therefore demonstrate how individual transcription factors function in a differentiation stage-specific manner to differentially affect the initiation versus maintenance of a developmental program. 
lp+ss: Transplanted human glial progenitor cells can mature in their host animal. <s0> human astrocytes are larger and more complex than those of infraprimate mammals, suggesting that their role in neural processing has expanded with evolution. <s1> to assess the cell-autonomous and species-selective properties of human glia, we engrafted human glial progenitor cells (gpcs) into neonatal immunodeficient mice. <s2> upon maturation, the recipient brains exhibited large numbers and high proportions of both human glial progenitors and astrocytes. <s3> the engrafted human glia were gap-junction-coupled to host astroglia, yet retained the size and pleomorphism of hominid astroglia, and propagated ca2+ signals 3-fold faster than their hosts. <s4> long-term potentiation (ltp) was sharply enhanced in the human glial chimeric mice, as was their learning, as assessed by barnes maze navigation, object-location memory, and both contextual and tone fear conditioning. <s5> mice allografted with murine gpcs showed no enhancement of either ltp or learning. <s6> these findings indicate that human glia differentially enhance both activity-dependent plasticity and learning in mice.

lp+ss: Transplanted human glial progenitor cells can mature in their host animal. <s0> vitamin d insufficiency affects almost 50% of the population worldwide. <s1> an estimated 1 billion people worldwide, across all ethnicities and age groups, have a vitamin d deficiency (vdd). <s2> this pandemic of hypovitaminosis d can mainly be attributed to lifestyle (for example, reduced outdoor activities) and environmental (for example, air pollution) factors that reduce exposure to sunlight, which is required for ultraviolet-b (uvb)-induced vitamin d production in the skin. <s3> high prevalence of vitamin d insufficiency is a particularly important public health issue because hypovitaminosis d is an independent risk factor for total mortality in the general population. <s4> current studies suggest that we may need more vitamin d than presently recommended to prevent chronic disease. <s5> as the number of people with vdd continues to increase, the importance of this hormone in overall health and the prevention of chronic diseases are at the forefront of research. <s6> vdd is very common in all age groups. <s7> as few foods contain vitamin d, guidelines recommended supplementation at suggested daily intake and tolerable upper limit levels. <s8> it is also suggested to measure the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin d level as the initial diagnostic test in patients at risk for deficiency. <s9> treatment with either vitamin d2 or vitamin d3 is recommended for deficient patients. <s10> a meta-analysis published in 2007 showed that vitamin d supplementation was associated with significantly reduced mortality. <s11> in this review, we will summarize the mechanisms that are presumed to underlie the relationship between vitamin d and understand its biology and clinical implications.

lp+ss: Tuberculosis incidence occurs at higher rates in more sparsely populated areas in the UK. <s0> this paper seeks to establish the strength of association between contemporary tuberculosis (tb) in england and wales and several potential aetiological factors. <s1> it presents an ecological analysis of standardised annual tb mortality rates for the 403 local authority districts between 1982 and 1992, disaggregated by age and sex. <s2> social, demographic and ethnicity measures from the 1981 and 1991 censuses and standardised annual aids-related mortality rates for young men are used to calculate poisson regression models. <s3> a strong association was found between all tb mortality groups and overcrowding at the household level. <s4> for women, no other measures improved the explanatory power of the models. <s5> in multiple regressions, both poverty and aids-related mortality explained additional variation in the model for younger men. <s6> the link between ethnicity and tuberculosis notifications was not reflected in this analysis of mortality. <s7> for all groups no evidence of a positive relationship with ethnicity was found, once overcrowding had been accounted for. <s8> the significance of household as opposed to district level crowding suggests that prolonged contact is required for disease transmission. <s9> regression analysis indicates that it is the overcrowding and poverty among ethnic populations that is significant for their tuberculosis mortality. <s10> the fact that the relationship between aids and tb is confined to the group most typical of aids patients provides evidence that aids has little influence on the level of tuberculosis mortality in the wider population. <s11> explanations for the observed relationship include preferential certification, migration for treatment and shortcomings in health care provision.

lp+ss: Tuberculosis-induced granulomas express different immune system protein signatures than the surrounding tissue. <s0> granulomas are the pathological hallmark of tuberculosis (tb). <s1> however, their function and mechanisms of formation remain poorly understood. <s2> to understand the role of granulomas in tb, we analyzed the proteomes of granulomas from subjects with tuberculosis in an unbiased manner. <s3> using laser-capture microdissection, mass spectrometry and confocal microscopy, we generated detailed molecular maps of human granulomas. <s4> we found that the centers of granulomas have a pro-inflammatory environment that is characterized by the presence of antimicrobial peptides, reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. <s5> conversely, the tissue surrounding the caseum has a comparatively anti-inflammatory signature. <s6> these findings are consistent across a set of six human subjects and in rabbits. <s7> although the balance between systemic pro- and anti-inflammatory signals is crucial to tb disease outcome, here we find that these signals are physically segregated within each granuloma. <s8> from the protein and lipid snapshots of human and rabbit lesions analyzed here, we hypothesize that the pathologic response to tb is shaped by the precise anatomical localization of these inflammatory pathways during the development of the granuloma.

lp+ss: Tuberculosis-induced granulomas express different immune system protein signatures than the surrounding tissue. <s0> in light of the emerging interplay between redox and metabolic signaling pathways we investigated the potential cross talk between nuclear factor e2-related factor 2 (nrf2) and amp-activated kinase (ampk), central regulators of the cellular redox and energy balance, respectively. <s1> making use of xanthohumol (xn) as an activator of both the ampk and the nrf2 signaling pathway we show that ampk exerts a positive influence on nrf2/heme oxygenase (ho)-1 signaling in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. <s2> genetic ablation and pharmacological inhibition of ampk blunts nrf2-dependent ho-1 expression by xn already at the mrna level. <s3> xn leads to ampk activation via interference with mitochondrial function and activation of liver kinase b1 as upstream ampk kinase. <s4> the subsequent ampk-mediated enhancement of the nrf2/ho-1 response does not depend on inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin, inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3β, or altered abundance of nrf2 (total and nuclear). <s5> however, reduced endoplasmic reticulum stress was identified and elaborated as a step in the ampk-augmented nrf2/ho-1 response. <s6> overall, we shed more light on the hitherto incompletely understood cross talk between the lkb1/ampk and the nrf2/ho-1 axis revealing for the first time involvement of the unfolded protein response as an additional player and suggesting tight cooperation between signaling pathways controlling cellular redox, energy, or protein homeostasis. 
lp+ss: Tumor development occurs in conjunction with suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. <s0> cerebral apolipoprotein e (apoe) has been implicated in neuronal protection and repair. <s1> due to the variable levels and types of estrogen receptors within different brain regions, the effect of estrogen on apoe and the mechanism of this effect may vary within different regions. <s2> ovariectomized female c57bl/6 mice were treated with pharmacological levels of 17 beta-estradiol or placebo for 5 days, resulting in supraphysiological plasma levels of estradiol in the treated mice. <s3> apoe and glial fibrillary acidic protein (gfap) levels were measured in the cortex, hippocampus and diencephalon. <s4> 17 beta-estradiol up-regulated apoe but not gfap in the cortex and diencephalon, whereas in the hippocampus, gfap and apoe were equally up-regulated. <s5> treatment of estrogen receptor (er) alpha knockout mice with 17 beta-estradiol or treatment of c57bl/6 mice with 17 alpha-estradiol, a poor estrogen receptor agonist, specifically induced apoe in the cortex, but not in the diencephalon. <s6> these results indicate that 17 beta-estradiol effects on apoe are either directly or indirectly mediated by er alpha in the diencephalon, while the effects in the cortex may be mediated by a non-classical mechanism or by er beta. <s7> measurement of mrna levels in estrogen versus placebo-treated wild-type mice indicated that the effect of 17 beta-estradiol on apoe was not associated with changes in apoe mrna levels. 
lp+ss: Tumor development occurs in conjunction with upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. <s0> aim to examine the therapeutic/preventive potential of liposome-encapsulated spironolactone (sp; lipo-sp) for acute lung injury (ali) and fibrosis.    <s1> materials & methods lipo-sp was prepared by the film-ultrasonic method, and physicochemical and pharmacokinetic characterized for oral administration (10 and 20 mg/kg for sp-loaded liposome; 20 mg/kg for free sp) in a mouse model bleomycin-induced ali.  <s2> results lipo-sp enhanced bioavailability of sp with significant amelioration in lung pathology. <s3> mechanistically, sp-mediated mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism contributes to inflammatory monocyte/macrophage modulation via an inhibitory effect on ly6c(hi) monocytosis-directed m2 polarization of alveolar macrophages. <s4> moreover, lipo-sp at lower dose (10 mg/kg) exhibited more improvement in body weight gain.  <s5> conclusion our data highlight lipo-sp as a promising approach with therapeutic/preventive potential for ali and fibrosis. 
lp+ss: Tumor development occurs in conjunction with upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. <s0> paraneoplastic thrombocytosis is associated with many solid tumors and often correlates with reduced survival. <s1> recent studies suggest that a pathogenic feed back loop may be operative between platelets and tumor cells, with reciprocal interactions between tumor growth/metastasis and thrombocytosis/platelet activation. <s2> specific molecular pathways have been identified in which tumors can stimulate platelet production and activation; activated platelets can, in turn, promote tumor growth and metastasis. <s3> taken together, these findings provide exciting new potential targets for therapeutic intervention. 
lp+ss: Tumor development occurs in conjunction with upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. <s0> acute paraquat poisoning is often fatal. <s1> many studies have investigated successful treatment modalities, but no standard treatment yet exists. <s2> the purpose of this study was to determine the predictors of survival after acute paraquat poisoning in 602 patients. <s3> the paraquat exposure was assessed based on the amount of ingested paraquat and a semiquantitative measure of the urine level of paraquat. <s4> initial clinical parameters including vital signs, hemoglobin, white-blood-cell count, ph, paco2, pao2, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, amylase, and glucose were obtained at the time of arrival at the emergency room. <s5> outcomes after acute paraquat poisoning were categorized as survivors and nonsurvivors. <s6> multiple logistic regression analysis was applied to assess the predictors of survival after acute paraquat poisoning. <s7> some patients (55.5%) survived after oral ingestion of paraquat, whereas all those exposed to paraquat percutaneous or inhalational route survived. <s8> the amount of paraquat (24.5% concentrate of 1,1'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridium dichloride) ingested was 45.6 +/- <s9> 74.1 ml (mean +/- <s10> sd). <s11> in addition to degree of paraquat exposure, survival after acute paraquat poisoning was associated with age, respiratory rate, ph, paco2, hemoglobin, white-blood-cell count, blood urea nitrogen, amylase, and the number of failed organs in multiple logistic regression analysis. <s12> in conclusion, young age, percutaneous or inhalational route, exposure to less paraquat, and lesser degrees of leukocytosis, acidosis, and renal, hepatic, and pancreatic failures on admission are good prognostic factors of survival after acute paraquat poisoning. 
lp+ss: Two variants of chromosome 6q21 are associated with radiation therapy-induced second malignancies in pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma patients. <s0> survivors of pediatric hodgkin's lymphoma are at risk for radiation therapy–induced second malignant neoplasms (smns). <s1> we identified two variants at chromosome 6q21 associated with smns in survivors of hodgkin's lymphoma treated with radiation therapy as children but not as adults. <s2> the variants comprise a risk locus associated with decreased basal expression of prdm1 (encoding pr domain containing 1, with znf domain) and impaired induction of the prdm1 protein after radiation exposure. <s3> these data suggest a new gene-exposure interaction that may implicate prdm1 in the etiology of radiation therapy-induced smns.

lp+ss: Type 1 Diabetes is associated with subtle perturbations in T reg development. <s0> numerous reports have demonstrated that cd4(+)cd25(+) regulatory t cells (tregs) from individuals with a range of human autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes, are deficient in their ability to control autologous proinflammatory responses when compared with nondiseased, control individuals. <s1> treg dysfunction could be a primary, causal event or may result from perturbations in the immune system during disease development. <s2> polymorphisms in genes associated with treg function, such as il2ra, confer a higher risk of autoimmune disease. <s3> although this suggests a primary role for defective tregs in autoimmunity, a link between il2ra gene polymorphisms and treg function has not been examined. <s4> we addressed this by examining the impact of an il2ra haplotype associated with type 1 diabetes on treg fitness and suppressive function. <s5> studies were conducted using healthy human subjects to avoid any confounding effects of disease. <s6> we demonstrated that the presence of an autoimmune disease-associated il2ra haplotype correlates with diminished il-2 responsiveness in ag-experienced cd4(+) t cells, as measured by phosphorylation of stat5a, and is associated with lower levels of foxp3 expression by tregs and a reduction in their ability to suppress proliferation of autologous effector t cells. <s7> these data offer a rationale that contributes to the molecular and cellular mechanisms through which polymorphisms in the il-2ra gene affect immune regulation, and consequently upon susceptibility to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

lp+ss: Type 1 Diabetes is associated with subtle perturbations in T reg development. <s0> autoimmune diseases are thought to result from imbalances in normal immune physiology and regulation. <s1> here, we show that autoimmune disease susceptibility and resistance alleles on mouse chromosome 3 (idd3) correlate with differential expression of the key immunoregulatory cytokine interleukin-2 (il-2). <s2> in order to test directly that an approximately twofold reduction in il-2 underpins the idd3-linked destabilization of immune homeostasis, we show that engineered haplodeficiency of il2 gene expression not only reduces t cell il-2 production by twofold but also mimics the autoimmune dysregulatory effects of the naturally occurring susceptibility alleles of il2. <s3> reduced il-2 production achieved by either genetic mechanism correlates with reduced function of cd4+ cd25+ regulatory t cells, which are critical for maintaining immune homeostasis. 
lp+ss: Type 1 Diabetes is associated with subtle perturbations in T reg development. <s0> background recent genome-wide association studies (gwas) have mapped several novel loci influencing blood lipid levels in caucasians. <s1> we sought to explore whether the genetic variants at newly identified lipid-associated loci were associated with chd susceptibility in a chinese han population.  <s2> methodology/principal findings we conducted a two-stage case-control study in a chinese han population. <s3> the first-stage, consisting of 1,376 chd cases and 1,376 sex and age- frequency matched controls, examined 5 novel lipid-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) identified from gwas among caucasians in relation to chd risk in chinese. <s4> we then validated significant snps in the second-stage, consisting of 1,269 cases and 2,745 controls. <s5> we also tested associations between snps within the five novel loci and blood lipid levels in 4,121 controls. <s6> we identified two novel snps (rs599839 in celsr2-psrc1-sort1 and rs16996148 in ncan-cilp2) that were significantly associated with reduced chd risk in chinese (odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) in the dominant model 0.76 (0.61-0.90; p = 0.001), 0.67 (0.57-0.77; p = 3.4×10(-8)), respectively). <s7> multiple linear regression analyses using dominant model showed that rs599839 was significantly associated with decreased ldl levels (p = 0.022) and rs16996148 was significantly associated with increased ldl and hdl levels (p = 2.9×10(-4) and 0.001, respectively).  <s8> conclusions/significance we identified two novel snps (rs599839 and rs16996148) at newly identified lipid-associated loci that were significantly associated with chd susceptibility in a chinese han population.

lp+ss: Ultrasound guidance significantly reduces the number of traumatic procedures when attempting needle insertion. <s0> adherens junctions (ajs), which are organized by adhesion proteins and the underlying actin cytoskeleton, probably sense pulling forces from adjacent cells and modulate opposing forces to maintain tissue integrity, but the regulatory mechanism remains unknown at the molecular level. <s1> although the possibility that α-catenin acts as a direct linker between the membrane and the actin cytoskeleton for aj formation and function has been minimized, here we show that α-catenin recruits vinculin, another main actin-binding protein of ajs, through force-dependent changes in α-catenin conformation. <s2> we identified regions in the α-catenin molecule that are required for its force-dependent binding of vinculin by introducing mutant α-catenin into cells and using in vitro binding assays. <s3> fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis for α-catenin mobility and the existence of an antibody recognizing α-catenin in a force-dependent manner further supported the notion that α-catenin is a tension transducer that translates mechanical stimuli into a chemical response, resulting in aj development. 
lp+ss: Understanding epigenetic regulation of replication is essential for the reational design of episomally replicating vectors. <s0> type 1 and type 2 diabetes are characterized by progressive beta-cell failure. <s1> apoptosis is probably the main form of beta-cell death in both forms of the disease. <s2> it has been suggested that the mechanisms leading to nutrient- and cytokine-induced beta-cell death in type 2 and type 1 diabetes, respectively, share the activation of a final common pathway involving interleukin (il)-1beta, nuclear factor (nf)-kappab, and fas. <s3> we review herein the similarities and differences between the mechanisms of beta-cell death in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. <s4> in the insulitis lesion in type 1 diabetes, invading immune cells produce cytokines, such as il-1beta, tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, and interferon (ifn)-gamma. <s5> il-1beta and/or tnf-alpha plus ifn-gamma induce beta-cell apoptosis via the activation of beta-cell gene networks under the control of the transcription factors nf-kappab and stat-1. <s6> nf-kappab activation leads to production of nitric oxide (no) and chemokines and depletion of endoplasmic reticulum (er) calcium. <s7> the execution of beta-cell death occurs through activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, via triggering of er stress and by the release of mitochondrial death signals. <s8> chronic exposure to elevated levels of glucose and free fatty acids (ffas) causes beta-cell dysfunction and may induce beta-cell apoptosis in type 2 diabetes. <s9> exposure to high glucose has dual effects, triggering initially "glucose hypersensitization" and later apoptosis, via different mechanisms. <s10> high glucose, however, does not induce or activate il-1beta, nf-kappab, or inducible nitric oxide synthase in rat or human beta-cells in vitro or in vivo in psammomys obesus. <s11> ffas may cause beta-cell apoptosis via er stress, which is nf-kappab and no independent. <s12> thus, cytokines and nutrients trigger beta-cell death by fundamentally different mechanisms, namely an nf-kappab-dependent mechanism that culminates in caspase-3 activation for cytokines and an nf-kappab-independent mechanism for nutrients. <s13> this argues against a unifying hypothesis for the mechanisms of beta-cell death in type 1 and type 2 diabetes and suggests that different approaches will be required to prevent beta-cell death in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. 
lp+ss: Up-regulation of the p53 pathway and related molecular events speeds cancer progression. <s0> cells from organisms with renewable tissues can permanently withdraw from the cell cycle in response to diverse stress, including dysfunctional telomeres, dna damage, strong mitogenic signals, and disrupted chromatin. <s1> this response, termed cellular senescence, is controlled by the p53 and rb tumor suppressor proteins and constitutes a potent anticancer mechanism. <s2> nonetheless, senescent cells acquire phenotypic changes that may contribute to aging and certain age-related diseases, including late-life cancer. <s3> thus, the senescence response may be antagonistically pleiotropic, promoting early-life survival by curtailing the development of cancer but eventually limiting longevity as dysfunctional senescent cells accumulate. 
lp+ss: Up-regulation of the p53 pathway and related molecular events speeds cancer progression. <s0> the tricyclic antidepressant, amitriptyline, is an effective drug for the treatment of chronic tension-type headache and for other chronic pain syndromes, but it is also effective in the prophylaxis of an episodic type of headache such as migraine. <s1> however, its efficacy in episodic tension-type headache has not yet been clarified. <s2> we compared the efficacy of amitriptyline (25 mg/day) in 82 nondepressed patients with either chronic or episodic tension-type headache in an open-label study. <s3> amitriptyline significantly reduced (p < 0.05) frequency and duration of headache as well as analgesic consumption in chronic, but not in episodic, tension-type headache. <s4> further placebo-controlled trials, possibly with higher doses of amitriptyline, might confirm if the different pattern of response to amitriptyline can be explained in terms of different involvement of central nociception and of peripheral myofascial factors in the chronic and in the episodic forms of tension-type headache.

lp+ss: Upregulation of PD1 causes the downmodulation of Satb1. <s0> &na; despite the importance of programmed cell death‐1 (pd‐1) in inhibiting t cell effector activity, the mechanisms regulating its expression remain poorly defined. <s1> we found that the chromatin organizer special at‐rich sequence‐binding protein‐1 (satb1) restrains pd‐1 expression induced upon t cell activation by recruiting a nucleosome remodeling deacetylase (nurd) complex to pdcd1 regulatory regions. <s2> satb1 deficienct t cells exhibited a 40‐fold increase in pd‐1 expression. <s3> tumor‐derived transforming growth factor &bgr; (tgf‐&bgr;) decreased satb1 expression through binding of smad proteins to the satb1 promoter. <s4> smad proteins also competed with the satb1‐nurd complex for binding to pdcd1 enhancers, releasing pdcd1 expression from satb1‐mediated repression, satb1‐deficient tumor‐reactive t cells lost effector activity more rapidly than wild‐type lymphocytes at tumor beds expressing pd‐1 ligand (cd274), and these differences were abrogated by sustained cd274 blockade. <s5> our findings suggest that satb1 functions to prevent premature t cell exhaustion by regulating pdcd1 expression upon t cell activation. <s6> dysregulation of this pathway in tumor‐infiltrating t cells results in diminished anti‐tumor immunity. <s7> graphical abstract figure. <s8> no caption available. <s9> highlightst cell activation increased the expression of satb1 in mature cd8+ and cd4+ t cellsrecruitment of the nurd repression complex by satb1 inhibits expression of pdcd1in tumors, tgf‐&bgr; inhibits satb1 expression in t cells, increasing pdcd1 expressionsatb1−/− t cells express high amounts of pd‐1 and have decreased anti‐tumor activity &na; stephen et al. show that the chromatin organizer satb1 controls expression levels of pd‐1 upon t cell activation through the recruitment of a de‐acetylase complex to regulatory regions of the pdcd1 gene. <s10> tumor‐derived tgf‐&bgr; dysregulates this pathway, unleashing pd‐1 expression in tumor‐infiltrating t cells and decreasing anti‐tumor immunity. 
lp+ss: Upregulation of PD1 causes the upregulation of Satb1. <s0> cells in tissues can organize into a broad spectrum of structures according to their function. <s1> drastic changes of organization, such as epithelial-mesenchymal transitions or the formation of spheroidal aggregates, are often associated either to tissue morphogenesis or to cancer progression. <s2> here, we study the organization of cell colonies by means of simulations of self-propelled particles with generic cell-like interactions. <s3> the interplay between cell softness, cell-cell adhesion, and contact inhibition of locomotion (cil) yields structures and collective dynamics observed in several existing tissue phenotypes. <s4> these include regular distributions of cells, dynamic cell clusters, gel-like networks, collectively migrating monolayers, and 3d aggregates. <s5> we give analytical predictions for transitions between noncohesive, cohesive, and 3d cell arrangements. <s6> we explicitly show how cil yields an effective repulsion that promotes cell dispersal, thereby hindering the formation of cohesive tissues. <s7> yet, in continuous monolayers, cil leads to collective cell motion, ensures tensile intercellular stresses, and opposes cell extrusion. <s8> thus, our work highlights the prominent role of cil in determining the emergent structures and dynamics of cell colonies. 
lp+ss: Upregulation of PD1 causes the upregulation of Satb1. <s0> despite declines in prevalence during the past two decades, sudden infant death syndrome (sids) continues to be the leading cause of death for infants aged between 1 month and 1 year in developed countries. <s1> behavioural risk factors identified in epidemiological studies include prone and side positions for infant sleep, smoke exposure, soft bedding and sleep surfaces, and overheating. <s2> evidence also suggests that pacifier use at sleep time and room sharing without bed sharing are associated with decreased risk of sids. <s3> although the cause of sids is unknown, immature cardiorespiratory autonomic control and failure of arousal responsiveness from sleep are important factors. <s4> gene polymorphisms relating to serotonin transport and autonomic nervous system development might make affected infants more vulnerable to sids. <s5> campaigns for risk reduction have helped to reduce sids incidence by 50-90%. <s6> however, to reduce the incidence even further, greater strides must be made in reducing prenatal smoke exposure and implementing other recommended infant care practices. <s7> continued research is needed to identify the pathophysiological basis of sids. 
lp+ss: Upregulation of dynein in Drosophila neurons increases the number of microtubule plus-ends growing toward the cell body of each neuron. <s0> axons and dendrites differ in both microtubule organization and in the organelles and proteins they contain. <s1> here we show that the microtubule motor dynein has a crucial role in polarized transport and in controlling the orientation of axonal microtubules in drosophila melanogaster dendritic arborization (da) neurons. <s2> changes in organelle distribution within the dendritic arbors of dynein mutant neurons correlate with a proximal shift in dendritic branch position. <s3> dynein is also necessary for the dendrite-specific localization of golgi outposts and the ion channel pickpocket. <s4> axonal microtubules are normally oriented uniformly plus-end-distal; however, without dynein, axons contain both plus- and minus-end distal microtubules. <s5> these data suggest that dynein is required for the distinguishing properties of the axon and dendrites: without dynein, dendritic organelles and proteins enter the axon and the axonal microtubules are no longer uniform in polarity.

lp+ss: Urbanization is an important risk factor related to the transmission of dengue fever. <s0> bile acids are recognized as metabolic modulators. <s1> the present study was aimed at evaluating the effects of a potent asbt inhibitor (264w94), which blocks intestinal absorption of bile acids, on glucose homeostasis in zucker diabetic fatty (zdf) rats. <s2> oral administration of 264w94 for two wk increased fecal bile acid concentrations and elevated non-fasting plasma total glp-1. <s3> treatment of 264w94 significantly decreased hba1c and glucose, and prevented the drop of insulin levels typical of zdf rats in a dose-dependent manner. <s4> an oral glucose tolerance test revealed up to two-fold increase in plasma total glp-1 and three-fold increase in insulin in 264w94 treated zdf rats at doses sufficient to achieve glycemic control. <s5> tissue mrna analysis indicated a decrease in farnesoid x receptor (fxr) activation in small intestines and the liver but co-administration of a fxr agonist (gw4064) did not attenuate 264w94 induced glucose lowering effects. <s6> in summary, our results demonstrate that inhibition of asbt increases bile acids in the distal intestine, promotes glp-1 release and may offer a new therapeutic strategy for type 2 diabetes mellitus.

lp+ss: Varenicline monotherapy is more effective after 26 weeks of treatment compared to combination nicotine replacement therapies with varenicline or bupropion. <s0> activating mutations within the k-ras gene occur in a high percentage of human pancreatic carcinomas. <s1> we reported previously that the presence of oncogenic, activated k-ras in human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines did not result in constitutive activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (erk1 and erk2). <s2> in the present study, we further characterized the erk signaling pathway in pancreatic tumor cell lines in order to determine whether the erk pathway is subject to a compensatory downregulation. <s3> we found that the attenuation of serum-induced erk activation was not due to a delay in the kinetics of erk phosphorylation. <s4> treatment with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate increased the level of erk phosphorylation, implicating a vanadate-sensitive tyrosine phosphatase in the negative regulation of erk. <s5> furthermore, expression of a dual specificity phosphatase capable of inactivating erk known as mitogen-activated protein (map) kinase phosphatase-2 (mkp-2) was elevated in most of the pancreatic tumor cell lines and correlated with the presence of active map kinase kinase (mek). <s6> taken together, these results suggest that pancreatic tumor cells expressing oncogenic k-ras compensate, in part, by upregulating the expression of mkp-2 to repress the erk signaling pathway.

lp+ss: Venules have less significant tunica adventitia than arterioles. <s0> background we have developed techniques to implant angiogenic patches onto the epicardium over regions of infarcted cardiac tissue to stimulate revascularization of the damaged tissue. <s1> these experiments used a scaffold-based 3d human dermal fibroblast culture (3dfc) as an epicardial patch. <s2> the 3dfc contains viable cells that secrete angiogenic growth factors and has previously been shown to stimulate angiogenic activity. <s3> the hypothesis tested was that a viable 3dfc cardiac patch would stimulate an angiogenic response within an area of infarcted cardiac tissue.  <s4> methods and results a coronary occlusion of a branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery was performed by thermal ligation in severe combined immunodeficient mice. <s5> 3dfcs with or without viable cells were sized to the damaged area, implanted in replicate mice onto the epicardium at the site of tissue injury, and compared with animals that received infarct surgery but no implant. <s6> fourteen and 30 days after surgery, hearts were exposed and photographed, and tissue samples were prepared for histology and cytochemistry. <s7> fourteen and 30 days after surgery, the damaged myocardium receiving viable 3dfc exhibited a significantly greater angiogenic response (including arterioles, venules, and capillaries) than nonviable and untreated control groups.  <s8> conclusions in this animal model, viable 3dfc stimulates angiogenesis within a region of cardiac infarction and can augment a repair response in damaged tissue. <s9> therefore, a potential use for 3dfc is the repair of myocardial tissue damaged by infarction. 
lp+ss: Venules have less significant tunica adventitia than arterioles. <s0> dominance relationships were studied for 249 out of 276 possible pair-wise combinations between 24 s-alleles of brassica campestris that had been isolated from two natural populations from turkey and japan. <s1> each f1 hybrid was test-crossed reciprocally against its respective parental s-homozygotes to determine the dominance relationships between the pair of s-alleles it contained. <s2> the 24 s-alleles were classified into two groups on the stigma side and three groups on the pollen side. <s3> in the stigma, codominance occurred frequently, and dominance or recessiveness seemed to appear according to the combination of s-alleles. <s4> in the pollen, codominance was less frequent, and there seemed to be a certain hierarchy of the dominance relationships as a whole, although dominance appeared with certain specific combinations of s-alleles. <s5> interactions among 24 s-alleles were different in the stigma and in the pollen. <s6> independent weakening of s-alleles was found between 20 pairs in the pollen, but only two in the stigma. <s7> this interaction seems to be correlated with recessiveness of s-alleles. 
lp+ss: VgrG (Tssl) protein punctures membranes by forming a spike at the tip of the tube apparatus. <s0> the bacterial type vi secretion system (t6ss) is a large multicomponent, dynamic macromolecular machine that has an important role in the ecology of many gram-negative bacteria. <s1> t6ss is responsible for translocation of a wide range of toxic effector molecules, allowing predatory cells to kill both prokaryotic as well as eukaryotic prey cells. <s2> the t6ss organelle is functionally analogous to contractile tails of bacteriophages and is thought to attack cells by initially penetrating them with a trimeric protein complex called the vgrg spike. <s3> neither the exact protein composition of the t6ss organelle nor the mechanisms of effector selection and delivery are known. <s4> here we report that proteins from the paar (proline-alanine-alanine-arginine) repeat superfamily form a sharp conical extension on the vgrg spike, which is further involved in attaching effector domains to the spike. <s5> the crystal structures of two paar-repeat proteins bound to vgrg-like partners show that these proteins sharpen the tip of the t6ss spike complex. <s6> we demonstrate that paar proteins are essential for t6ss-mediated secretion and target cell killing by vibrio cholerae and acinetobacter baylyi. <s7> our results indicate a new model of the t6ss organelle in which the vgrg-paar spike complex is decorated with multiple effectors that are delivered simultaneously into target cells in a single contraction-driven translocation event.

lp+ss: VgrG (Tssl) protein punctures membranes by forming a spike at the tip of the tube apparatus. <s0> background there is overwhelming evidence that behavioural factors influence health, but their combined impact on the general population is less well documented. <s1> we aimed to quantify the potential combined impact of four health behaviours on mortality in men and women living in the general community.  <s2> methods and findings we examined the prospective relationship between lifestyle and mortality in a prospective population study of 20,244 men and women aged 45-79 y with no known cardiovascular disease or cancer at baseline survey in 1993-1997, living in the general community in the united kingdom, and followed up to 2006. <s3> participants scored one point for each health behaviour: current non-smoking, not physically inactive, moderate alcohol intake (1-14 units a week) and plasma vitamin c >50 mmol/l indicating fruit and vegetable intake of at least five servings a day, for a total score ranging from zero to four. <s4> after an average 11 y follow-up, the age-, sex-, body mass-, and social class-adjusted relative risks (95% confidence intervals) for all-cause mortality(1,987 deaths) for men and women who had three, two, one, and zero compared to four health behaviours were respectively, 1.39 (1.21-1.60), 1.95 (1.70-2.25), 2.52 (2.13-3.00), and 4.04 (2.95-5.54) p < 0.001 trend. <s5> the relationships were consistent in subgroups stratified by sex, age, body mass index, and social class, and after excluding deaths within 2 y. <s6> the trends were strongest for cardiovascular causes. <s7> the mortality risk for those with four compared to zero health behaviours was equivalent to being 14 y younger in chronological age.  <s8> conclusions four health behaviours combined predict a 4-fold difference in total mortality in men and women, with an estimated impact equivalent to 14 y in chronological age. 
lp+ss: VgrG (Tssl) protein punctures membranes by forming a spike at the tip of the tube apparatus. <s0> numerous transcription factors (tfs) encode information about upstream signals in the dynamics of their activation, but how downstream genes decode these dynamics remains poorly understood. <s1> using microfluidics to control the nucleocytoplasmic translocation dynamics of the budding yeast tf msn2, we elucidate the principles that govern how different promoters convert dynamical msn2 input into gene expression output in single cells. <s2> combining modeling and experiments, we classify promoters according to their signal-processing behavior and reveal that multiple, distinct gene expression programs can be encoded in the dynamics of msn2. <s3> we show that both oscillatory tf dynamics and slow promoter kinetics lead to higher noise in gene expression. <s4> furthermore, we show that the promoter activation timescale is related to nucleosome remodeling. <s5> our findings imply a fundamental trade-off: although the cell can exploit different promoter classes to differentially control gene expression using tf dynamics, gene expression noise fundamentally limits how much information can be encoded in the dynamics of a single tf and reliably decoded by promoters.

lp+ss: Weighed food records (WFR) result in high completion since they're cheap to run and impose low participant burden. <s0> there is a growing interest in the cell-cell communication roles in cancer mediated by secreted vesicles termed exosomes. <s1> in this study, we examined whether exosomes produced by cancer cells could transmit information to normal stromal fibroblasts and trigger a cellular response. <s2> we found that some cancer-derived exosomes could trigger elevated α-smooth muscle actin expression and other changes consistent with the process of fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts. <s3> we show that tgf-β is expressed at the exosome surface in association with the transmembrane proteoglycan betaglycan. <s4> although existing in a latent state, this complex was fully functional in eliciting smad-dependent signaling. <s5> inhibiting either signaling or betaglycan expression attenuated differentiation. <s6> while the kinetics and overall magnitude of the response were similar to that achieved with soluble tgf-β, we identified important qualitative differences unique to the exosomal route of tgf-β delivery, as exemplified by a significant elevation in fibroblast fgf2 production. <s7> this hitherto unknown trigger for instigating cellular differentiation in a distinctive manner has major implications for mechanisms underlying cancer-recruited stroma, fibrotic diseases, and wound-healing responses. 
lp+ss: Weighed food records (WFR) result in poor completion since they're costly to run and impose high participant burden. <s0> micrornas (mirnas) are evolutionarily conserved small noncoding rnas involved in the regulation of gene expression and protein translation. <s1> many studies have shown that they play a crucial role in driving organ and tissue differentiation during embryogenesis and in the fine-tuning of fundamental biological processes, such as proliferation and apoptosis. <s2> growing evidence indicates that their deregulation plays an important role in cancer onset and progression as well, where they act as oncogenes or oncosuppressors. <s3> in this review, we highlight the most recent findings regarding the role of mirnas in hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) by analyzing the possible mechanisms by which they contribute to this neoplasm. <s4> moreover, we discuss the possible role of circulating mirnas as biomarkers, a field that needs urgent improvement in the clinical surveillance of hcc, and the fascinating possibility of using them as therapeutic targets or drugs themselves.

lp+ss: YAP/TAZ is required in intestinal regeneration in mouse models of ulcerative colitis. <s0> tissue regeneration requires dynamic cellular adaptation to the wound environment. <s1> it is currently unclear how this is orchestrated at the cellular level and how cell fate is affected by severe tissue damage. <s2> here we dissect cell fate transitions during colonic regeneration in a mouse dextran sulfate sodium (dss) colitis model, and we demonstrate that the epithelium is transiently reprogrammed into a primitive state. <s3> this is characterized by de novo expression of fetal markers as well as suppression of markers for adult stem and differentiated cells. <s4> the fate change is orchestrated by remodeling the extracellular matrix (ecm), increased fak/src signaling, and ultimately yap/taz activation. <s5> in a defined cell culture system recapitulating the extracellular matrix remodeling observed in vivo, we show that a collagen 3d matrix supplemented with wnt ligands is sufficient to sustain endogenous yap/taz and induce conversion of cell fate. <s6> this provides a simple model for tissue regeneration, implicating cellular reprogramming as an essential element.

lp+ss: YAP/TAZ is required in intestinal regeneration in mouse models of ulcerative colitis. <s0> probing a wide range of cellular phenotypes in neurodevelopmental disorders using patient-derived neural progenitor cells (npcs) can be facilitated by 3d assays, as 2d systems cannot entirely recapitulate the arrangement of cells in the brain. <s1> here, we developed a previously unidentified 3d migration and differentiation assay in layered hydrogels to examine how these processes are affected in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as rett syndrome. <s2> our soft 3d system mimics the brain environment and accelerates maturation of neurons from human induced pluripotent stem cell (ipsc)-derived npcs, yielding electrophysiologically active neurons within just 3 wk. <s3> using this platform, we revealed a genotype-specific effect of methyl-cpg-binding protein-2 (mecp2) dysfunction on ipsc-derived neuronal migration and maturation (reduced neurite outgrowth and fewer synapses) in 3d layered hydrogels. <s4> thus, this 3d system expands the range of neural phenotypes that can be studied in vitro to include those influenced by physical and mechanical stimuli or requiring specific arrangements of multiple cell types. 
lp+ss: YAP/TAZ is required in intestinal regeneration in mouse models of ulcerative colitis. <s0> reprogramming of somatic cells into pluripotency stem cell state has opened new opportunities in cell replacement therapy and disease modeling in a number of neurological disorders. <s1> it still remains unknown, however, to what degree the grafted human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hipscs) differentiate into a functional neuronal phenotype and if they integrate into the host circuitry. <s2> here, we present a detailed characterization of the functional properties and synaptic integration of hipsc-derived neurons grafted in an in vitro model of hyperexcitable epileptic tissue, namely organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (ohscs), and in adult rats in vivo. <s3> the hipscs were first differentiated into long-term self-renewing neuroepithelial stem (lt-nes) cells, which are known to form primarily gabaergic neurons. <s4> when differentiated in ohscs for 6 weeks, lt-nes cell-derived neurons displayed neuronal properties such as tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium currents and action potentials (aps), as well as both spontaneous and evoked postsynaptic currents, indicating functional afferent synaptic inputs. <s5> the grafted cells had a distinct electrophysiological profile compared to host cells in the ohscs with higher input resistance, lower resting membrane potential, and aps with lower amplitude and longer duration. <s6> to investigate the origin of synaptic afferents to the grafted lt-nes cell-derived neurons, the host neurons were transduced with channelrhodopsin-2 (chr2) and optogenetically activated by blue light. <s7> simultaneous recordings of synaptic currents in grafted lt-nes cell-derived neurons using whole-cell patch-clamp technique at 6 weeks after grafting revealed limited synaptic connections from host neurons. <s8> longer differentiation times, up to 24 weeks after grafting in vivo, revealed more mature intrinsic properties and extensive synaptic afferents from host neurons to the lt-nes cell-derived neurons, suggesting that these cells require extended time for differentiation/maturation and synaptogenesis. <s9> however, even at this later time point, the grafted cells maintained a higher input resistance. <s10> these data indicate that grafted lt-nes cell-derived neurons receive ample afferent input from the host brain. <s11> since the lt-nes cells used in this study show a strong propensity for gabaergic differentiation, the host-to-graft synaptic afferents may facilitate inhibitory neurotransmitter release, and normalize hyperexcitable neuronal networks in brain diseases, for example, such as epilepsy. 
lp+ss: aPKCz causes tumour suppression by affecting glutamine metabolism. <s0> tumor cells have high-energetic and anabolic needs and are known to adapt their metabolism to be able to survive and keep proliferating under conditions of nutrient stress. <s1> we show that pkcζ deficiency promotes the plasticity necessary for cancer cells to reprogram their metabolism to utilize glutamine through the serine biosynthetic pathway in the absence of glucose. <s2> pkcζ represses the expression of two key enzymes of the pathway, phgdh and psat1, and phosphorylates phgdh at key residues to inhibit its enzymatic activity. <s3> interestingly, the loss of pkcζ in mice results in enhanced intestinal tumorigenesis and increased levels of these two metabolic enzymes, whereas patients with low levels of pkcζ have a poor prognosis. <s4> furthermore, pkcζ and caspase-3 activities are correlated with phgdh levels in human intestinal tumors. <s5> taken together, this demonstrates that pkcζ is a critical metabolic tumor suppressor in mouse and human cancer.

lp+ss: aPKCz causes tumour suppression by affecting glutamine metabolism. <s0> successful pregnancy requires coordination of an array of signals and factors from multiple tissues. <s1> one such element, liver receptor homolog-1 (lrh-1), is an orphan nuclear receptor that regulates metabolism and hormone synthesis. <s2> it is strongly expressed in granulosa cells of ovarian follicles and in the corpus luteum of rodents and humans. <s3> germline ablation of nr5a2 (also called lrh-1), the gene coding for lrh-1, in mice is embryonically lethal at gastrulation. <s4> depletion of lrh-1 in the ovarian follicle shows that it regulates genes required for both steroid synthesis and ovulation. <s5> to study the effects of lrh-1 on mouse gestation, we genetically disrupted its expression in the corpus luteum, resulting in luteal insufficiency. <s6> hormone replacement permitted embryo implantation but was followed by gestational failure with impaired endometrial decidualization, compromised placental formation, fetal growth retardation and fetal death. <s7> lrh-1 is also expressed in the mouse and human endometrium, and in a primary culture of human endometrial stromal cells, reduction of nr5a2 transcript abundance by rna interference abrogated decidualization. <s8> these findings show that lrh-1 is necessary for maintenance of the corpus luteum, for promotion of decidualization and for formation of the placenta. <s9> it therefore has multiple, indispensible roles in establishing and sustaining pregnancy.

lp+ss: eRNAs influence is linked to senescence, aging, and carcinogenesis. <s0> aire-expressing medullary thymic epithelial cells (mtecs) play a key role in preventing autoimmunity by expressing tissue-restricted antigens to help purge the emerging t cell receptor repertoire of self-reactive specificities. <s1> here we demonstrate a novel role for a cd4+3− inducer cell population, previously linked to development of organized secondary lymphoid structures and maintenance of t cell memory in the functional regulation of aire-mediated promiscuous gene expression in the thymus. <s2> cd4+3− cells are closely associated with mtecs in adult thymus, and in fetal thymus their appearance is temporally linked with the appearance of aire+ mtecs. <s3> we show that rankl signals from this cell promote the maturation of rank-expressing cd80−aire− mtec progenitors into cd80+aire+ mtecs, and that transplantation of rank-deficient thymic stroma into immunodeficient hosts induces autoimmunity. <s4> collectively, our data reveal cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to the generation of aire+ mtecs and highlight a previously unrecognized role for cd4+3−rankl+ inducer cells in intrathymic self-tolerance. 
lp+ss: mcm 5 s 2 U is required for proper decoding of NNR codons in eukaryotes. <s0> the wobble modification in trnas, 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine (mcm(5)s(2)u), is required for the proper decoding of nnr codons in eukaryotes. <s1> the 2-thio group confers conformational rigidity of mcm(5)s(2)u by largely fixing the c3'-endo ribose puckering, ensuring stable and accurate codon-anticodon pairing. <s2> we have identified five genes in saccharomyces cerevisiae, yil008w (urm1), yhr111w (uba4), yor251c (tum1), ynl119w (ncs2) and ygl211w (ncs6), that are required for 2-thiolation of mcm(5)s(2)u. an in vitro sulfur transfer experiment revealed that tum1p stimulated the cysteine desulfurase of nfs1p, and accepted persulfide sulfurs from nfs1p. <s3> urm1 is a ubiquitin-related modifier, and uba4 is an e1-like enzyme involved in protein urmylation. <s4> the carboxy-terminus of urm1p was activated as an acyl-adenylate (-coamp), then thiocarboxylated (-cosh) by uba4p. <s5> the activated thiocarboxylate can be utilized in the subsequent reactions for 2-thiouridine formation, mediated by ncs2p/ncs6p. <s6> we could successfully reconstitute the 2-thiouridine formation in vitro using recombinant proteins. <s7> this study revealed that 2-thiouridine formation shares a pathway and chemical reactions with protein urmylation. <s8> the sulfur-flow of eukaryotic 2-thiouridine formation is distinct mechanism from the bacterial sulfur-relay system which is based on the persulfide chemistry.

lp+ss: miR-142-5P is a known regulator of raised body temperature. <s0> fever is commonly used to diagnose disease and is consistently associated with increased mortality in critically ill patients. <s1> however, the molecular controls of elevated body temperature are poorly understood. <s2> we discovered that the expression of rna-binding motif protein 3 (rbm3), known to respond to cold stress and to modulate microrna (mirna) expression, was reduced in 30 patients with fever, and in thp-1-derived macrophages maintained at a fever-like temperature (40 °c). <s3> notably, rbm3 expression is reduced during fever whether or not infection is demonstrable. <s4> reduced rbm3 expression resulted in increased expression of rbm3-targeted temperature-sensitive mirnas, we termed thermomirs. <s5> thermomirs such as mir-142-5p and mir-143 in turn target endogenous pyrogens including il-6, il6st, tlr2, pge2 and tnf to complete a negative feedback mechanism, which may be crucial to prevent pathological hyperthermia. <s6> using normal pbmcs that were exogenously exposed to fever-like temperature (40 °c), we further demonstrate the trend by which decreased levels of rbm3 were associated with increased levels of mir-142-5p and mir-143 and vice versa over a 24 h time course. <s7> collectively, our results indicate the existence of a negative feedback loop that regulates fever via reduced rbm3 levels and increased expression of mir-142-5p and mir-143.

lp+ss: miR-142-5P is a known regulator of raised body temperature. <s0> objectives we investigated the role of cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin-6 (il-6) in cachexia development in newly diagnosed nonsmall cell lung cancer (nsclc) patients.  <s1> methods : we evaluated 44 (m/f:41/3) nsclc patients and 12 (m/f:10/2) age matched healthy smokers. <s2> nsclc cases with a weight loss of > or =10% consisted the cachectic group (n:23, m/f:21/2) and the ones with <10% weight loss consisted the noncachectic group (n:21, m/f:19/2).  <s3> results body mass index (bmi) of cachectics was significantly lower than that of noncachectics (21.0 +/- 2.9 versus 24.5 +/- <s4> 3.6, p = 0.02) and controls (21.0 +/- 2.9 versus 25.5 +/- 2.6, p = 0.01). <s5> serum tnf-alpha level did not differ between cachectic and noncachectics (37.3 +/- <s6> 39.1 and 51.6 +/- <s7> 84.2 pg/ml, respectively). <s8> however, it was significantly higher in nsclc patients compared with controls (44.1 +/- 64.3 and 15.1 +/- <s9> 14.3 pg/ml, p = 0.03). <s10> serum il-6 level was not different between 3 groups (6.4 +/- 4.1, 8.9 +/- <s11> 16.3, and 4.1 +/- <s12> 3.5 pg/ml, respectively) <s13> but it correlated significantly with tnf-alpha (r = 0.4, p = 0.006) and bmi (r = -0.3, p = 0.03). <s14> erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr) correlated significantly with tnf-alpha (r = 0.4, p = 0.003) and bmi (r = -0.3, p = 0.03). <s15> among 44 cases, survival of 12 and 17 patients was recorded in cachectics and noncachectics, with no statistical difference (12.2 +/- 3.7 and 11.2 +/- <s16> 1.0 months, respectively).  <s17> conclusions tnf-alpha and il-6 levels did not differ significantly between cachectics and noncachectics. <s18> however, significant correlations between il-6, bmi, and tnf-alpha suggested that these cytokines acted as cofactors in weight loss. <s19> survival was neither influenced by bmi, nor the cytokine levels in the present study. <s20> the significant correlation of esr with tnf-alpha suggested that esr could provide valuable clue for considerable weight loss in the follow-up of nsclc patients. 
lp+ss: miR-142-5P is a known regulator of raised body temperature. <s0> background carbon nanotubes (cnt) hold great promise to create new and better products for commercial and biomedical applications, but their long-term adverse health effects are a major concern. <s1> the objective of this study was to address human lung cancer risks associated with chronic pulmonary exposure to single-walled (sw) cnt through the fundamental understanding of cellular and molecular processes leading to carcinogenesis. <s2> we hypothesized that the acquisition of cancer stem cells (csc), a subpopulation that drive tumor initiation and progression, may contribute to cnt carcinogenesis.  <s3> methods non-tumorigenic human lung epithelial cells were chronically exposed to well-dispersed swcnt for a period of 6 months at the physiologically relevant concentration of 0.02 μg/cm2 surface area dose. <s4> chronic swcnt-exposed cells were evaluated for the presence of csc-like cells under csc-selective conditions of tumor spheres and side population (sp). <s5> csc-like cells were isolated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting and were assessed for aggressive behaviors, including acquired apoptosis resistance and increased cell migration and invasion in vitro, and tumor-initiating capability in vivo. <s6> non-small cell lung cancer cells served as a positive control.  <s7> results we demonstrated for the first time the existence of csc-like cells in all clones of chronic swcnt-exposed lung epithelial cells. <s8> these csc-like cells, in contrary to their non-csc counterpart, possessed all biological features of lung csc that are central to irreversible malignant transformation, self-renewal, aggressive cancer behaviors, and in vivo tumorigenesis. <s9> these cells also displayed aberrant stem cell markers, notably nanog, sox-2, sox-17 and e-cadherin. <s10> restored expression of tumor suppressor p53 abrogated csc properties of csc-like cells. <s11> furthermore, we identified specific stem cell surface markers cd24low and cd133high that are associated with swcnt-induced csc formation and tumorigenesis.  <s12> conclusions our findings provide new and compelling evidence for the acquisition of csc-like cells induced by chronic swcnt exposure, which are likely to be a major driving force for swcnt tumorigenesis. <s13> thus, our study supports prudent adoption of prevention strategies and implementation of exposure control for swcnt. <s14> we also suggest that the detection of csc and associated surface markers may provide an effective screening tool for prediction of the carcinogenic potential of swcnt and related nanoparticles.

lp+ss: miR-142-5P is a temperature-sensitive microRNA (miRNA). <s0> sp1-like proteins are characterized by three conserved c-terminal zinc finger motifs that bind gc-rich sequences found in promoters of numerous genes essential for mammalian cell homeostasis. <s1> these proteins behave as transcriptional activators or repressors. <s2> although significant information has been reported on the molecular mechanisms by which sp1-like activators function, relatively little is known about mechanisms for repressor proteins. <s3> here we report the functional characterization of bteb3, a ubiquitously expressed sp1-like transcriptional repressor. <s4> gal4 assays show that the n terminus of bteb3 contains regions that can act as direct repressor domains. <s5> immunoprecipitation assays reveal that bteb3 interacts with the co-repressor msin3a and the histone deacetylase protein hdac-1. <s6> gel shift assays demonstrate that bteb3 specifically binds the bte site, a well characterized gc-rich dna element, with an affinity similar to that of sp1. <s7> reporter and gel shift assays in chinese hamster ovary cells show that bteb3 can also mediate repression by competing with sp1 for bte binding. <s8> thus, the characterization of this protein expands the repertoire of bteb-like members of the sp1 family involved in transcriptional repression. <s9> furthermore, our results suggest a mechanism of repression for bteb3 involving direct repression by the n terminus via interaction with msin3a and hdac-1 and competition with sp1 via the dna-binding domain. 
lp+ss: miRNAs enforce homeostasis by suppressing low-level ''leaky'' transcription. <s0> biological systems use a variety of mechanisms to maintain their functions in the face of environmental and genetic perturbations. <s1> increasing evidence suggests that, among their roles as posttranscriptional repressors of gene expression, micrornas (mirnas) help to confer robustness to biological processes by reinforcing transcriptional programs and attenuating aberrant transcripts, and they may in some network contexts help suppress random fluctuations in transcript copy number. <s2> these activities have important consequences for normal development and physiology, disease, and evolution. <s3> here, we will discuss examples and principles of mirnas that contribute to robustness in animal systems.

lp+ss: p16INK4A degradation is  linked to an abnormal wound response caused by the microinvasive step of advanced Oral Potentially Malignant Lesions (OPMLs). <s0> the revised criteria for the classification of rheumatoid arthritis (ra) were formulated from a computerized analysis of 262 contemporary, consecutively studied patients with ra and 262 control subjects with rheumatic diseases other than ra (non-ra). <s1> the new criteria are as follows: 1) morning stiffness in and around joints lasting at least 1 hour before maximal improvement; 2) soft tissue swelling (arthritis) of 3 or more joint areas observed by a physician; 3) swelling (arthritis) of the proximal interphalangeal, metacarpophalangeal, or wrist joints; 4) symmetric swelling (arthritis); 5) rheumatoid nodules; 6) the presence of rheumatoid factor; and 7) radiographic erosions and/or periarticular osteopenia in hand and/or wrist joints. <s2> criteria 1 through 4 must have been present for at least 6 weeks. <s3> rheumatoid arthritis is defined by the presence of 4 or more criteria, and no further qualifications (classic, definite, or probable) or list of exclusions are required. <s4> in addition, a "classification tree" schema is presented which performs equally as well as the traditional (4 of 7) format. <s5> the new criteria demonstrated 91-94% sensitivity and 89% specificity for ra when compared with non-ra rheumatic disease control subjects. 
lp+ss: p16INK4A degradation is  linked to an abnormal wound response caused by the microinvasive step of advanced Oral Potentially Malignant Lesions (OPMLs). <s0> arterial smooth muscle cells (smcs) are arrested in the g1 phase of the cell cycle on polymerized type i collagen fibrils, while monomer collagen supports smc proliferation. <s1> cyclin e-associated kinase and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cdk2) phosphorylation are inhibited on polymerized collagen, and levels of the cdk2 inhibitors p27kip1 and p21cip1/waf1 are increased compared with smcs on monomer collagen. <s2> p27kip1 associates with the cyclin e-cdk2-p21cip1/waf1 complex in smcs on polymerized collagen. <s3> monovalent blocking antibodies to alpha2 integrins, integrins that mediate adhesion to both forms of collagen, mimic these effects on monomer collagen. <s4> furthermore, polymerized collagen rapidly suppresses p70 s6 kinase, a possible regulator of p27kip1. <s5> thus, fibrillar collagen specifically regulates early integrin signaling that may lead to up-regulation of cdk2 inhibitors and inhibition of smc proliferation. 
lp+ss: p16INK4A degradation is  linked to an abnormal wound response caused by the microinvasive step of advanced Oral Potentially Malignant Lesions (OPMLs). <s0> monitoring cancer and aging in vivo remains experimentally challenging. <s1> here, we describe a luciferase knockin mouse (p16(luc)), which faithfully reports expression of p16(ink4a), a tumor suppressor and aging biomarker. <s2> lifelong assessment of luminescence in p16(+/luc) mice revealed an exponential increase with aging, which was highly variable in a cohort of contemporaneously housed, syngeneic mice. <s3> expression of p16(ink4a) with aging did not predict cancer development, suggesting that the accumulation of senescent cells is not a principal determinant of cancer-related death. <s4> in 14 of 14 tested tumor models, expression of p16(luc) was focally activated by early neoplastic events, enabling visualization of tumors with sensitivity exceeding other imaging modalities. <s5> activation of p16(ink4a) was noted in the emerging neoplasm and surrounding stromal cells. <s6> this work suggests that p16(ink4a) activation is a characteristic of all emerging cancers, making the p16(luc) allele a sensitive, unbiased reporter of neoplastic transformation. 
lp+ss: p16INK4A degradation is encoded by CDKN2A. <s0> mammals can taste a wide repertoire of chemosensory stimuli. <s1> two unrelated families of receptors (t1rs and t2rs) mediate responses to sweet, amino acids, and bitter compounds. <s2> here, we demonstrate that knockouts of trpm5, a taste trp ion channel, or plcbeta2, a phospholipase c selectively expressed in taste tissue, abolish sweet, amino acid, and bitter taste reception, but do not impact sour or salty tastes. <s3> therefore, despite relying on different receptors, sweet, amino acid, and bitter transduction converge on common signaling molecules. <s4> using plcbeta2 taste-blind animals, we then examined a fundamental question in taste perception: how taste modalities are encoded at the cellular level. <s5> mice engineered to rescue plcbeta2 function exclusively in bitter-receptor expressing cells respond normally to bitter tastants but do not taste sweet or amino acid stimuli. <s6> thus, bitter is encoded independently of sweet and amino acids, and taste receptor cells are not broadly tuned across these modalities. 
lp+ss: p75 NTR - associated cell death executor (NADE) interacts with the p75 NTR death domain <s0> purpose there is a need for valid and reliable short scales that can be used to assess social networks and social supports and to screen for social isolation in older persons.  <s1> design and methods the present study is a cross-national and cross-cultural evaluation of the performance of an abbreviated version of the lubben social network scale (lsns-6), which was used to screen for social isolation among community-dwelling older adult populations in three european countries. <s2> based on the concept of lack of redundancy of social ties we defined clinical cut-points of the lsns-6 for identifying persons deemed at risk for social isolation.  <s3> results among all three samples, the lsns-6 and two subscales (family and friends) demonstrated high levels of internal consistency, stable factor structures, and high correlations with criterion variables. <s4> the proposed clinical cut-points showed good convergent validity, and classified 20% of the respondents in hamburg, 11% of those in solothurn (switzerland), and 15% of those in london as at risk for social isolation.    <s5> implications we conclude that abbreviated scales such as the lsns-6 should be considered for inclusion in practice protocols of gerontological practitioners. <s6> screening older persons based on the lsns-6 provides quantitative information on their family and friendship ties, and identifies persons at increased risk for social isolation who might benefit from in-depth assessment and targeted interventions. 
lp+ss: qSOFA scores are associated with length of stay in emergency department patients. <s0> here, we report that genome editing by crispr–cas9 induces a p53-mediated dna damage response and cell cycle arrest in immortalized human retinal pigment epithelial cells, leading to a selection against cells with a functional p53 pathway. <s1> inhibition of p53 prevents the damage response and increases the rate of homologous recombination from a donor template. <s2> these results suggest that p53 inhibition may improve the efficiency of genome editing of untransformed cells and that p53 function should be monitored when developing cell-based therapies utilizing crispr–cas9. <s3> crispr–cas9-induced dna damage triggers p53 to limit the efficiency of gene editing in immortalized human retinal pigment epithelial cells. 
lp+ss: qSOFA scores are associated with length of stay in emergency department patients. <s0> importance the sepsis-3 criteria emphasized the value of a change of 2 or more points in the sequential [sepsis-related] organ failure assessment (sofa) score, introduced quick sofa (qsofa), and removed the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (sirs) criteria from the sepsis definition. <s1> objective externally validate and assess the discriminatory capacities of an increase in sofa score by 2 or more points, 2 or more sirs criteria, or a qsofa score of 2 or more points for outcomes among patients who are critically ill with suspected infection. <s2> design, setting, and participants retrospective cohort analysis of 184 875 patients with an infection-related primary admission diagnosis in 182 australian and new zealand intensive care units (icus) from 2000 through 2015. <s3> exposures sofa, qsofa, and sirs criteria applied to data collected within 24 hours of icu admission. <s4> main outcomes and measures the primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. <s5> in-hospital mortality or icu length of stay (los) of 3 days or more was a composite secondary outcome. <s6> discrimination was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auroc). <s7> adjusted analyses were performed using a model of baseline risk determined using variables independent of the scoring systems. <s8> results among 184 875 patients (mean age, 62.9 years [sd, 17.4]; women, 82 540 [44.6%]; most common diagnosis bacterial pneumonia, 32 634 [17.7%]), a total of 34 578 patients (18.7%) died in the hospital, and 102 976 patients (55.7%) died or experienced an icu los of 3 days or more. <s9> sofa score increased by 2 or more points in 90.1%; 86.7% manifested 2 or more sirs criteria, and 54.4% had a qsofa score of 2 or more points. <s10> sofa demonstrated significantly greater discrimination for in-hospital mortality (crude auroc, 0.753 [99% ci, 0.750-0.757]) than sirs criteria (crude auroc, 0.589 [99% ci, 0.585-0.593]) or qsofa (crude auroc, 0.607 [99% ci, 0.603-0.611]). <s11> incremental improvements were 0.164 (99% ci, 0.159-0.169) for sofa vs sirs criteria and 0.146 (99% ci, 0.142-0.151) for sofa vs qsofa (p <.001). <s12> sofa (auroc, 0.736 [99% ci, 0.733-0.739]) outperformed the other scores for the secondary end point (sirs criteria: auroc, 0.609 [99% ci, 0.606-0.612]; qsofa: auroc, 0.606 [99% ci, 0.602-0.609]). <s13> incremental improvements were 0.127 (99% ci, 0.123-0.131) for sofa vs sirs criteria and 0.131 (99% ci, 0.127-0.134) for sofa vs qsofa (p <.001). <s14> findings were consistent for both outcomes in multiple sensitivity analyses. <s15> conclusions and relevance among adults with suspected infection admitted to an icu, an increase in sofa score of 2 or more had greater prognostic accuracy for in-hospital mortality than sirs criteria or the qsofa score. <s16> these findings suggest that sirs criteria and qsofa may have limited utility for predicting mortality in an icu setting. 
lp+ss: r-protein chaperones are found in complexes with their r-protein binding partners. <s0> biogenesis of ribosomes is an essential cellular process conserved across all eukaryotes and is known to require >170 genes for the assembly, modification, and trafficking of ribosome components through multiple cellular compartments. <s1> despite intensive study, this pathway likely involves many additional genes. <s2> here, we employ network-guided genetics-an approach for associating candidate genes with biological processes that capitalizes on recent advances in functional genomic and proteomic studies-to computationally identify additional ribosomal biogenesis genes. <s3> we experimentally evaluated >100 candidate yeast genes in a battery of assays, confirming involvement of at least 15 new genes, including previously uncharacterized genes (ydl063c, yil091c, yor287c, yor006c/tsr3, yol022c/tsr4). <s4> we associate the new genes with specific aspects of ribosomal subunit maturation, ribosomal particle association, and ribosomal subunit nuclear export, and we identify genes specifically required for the processing of 5s, 7s, 20s, 27s, and 35s rrnas. <s5> these results reveal new connections between ribosome biogenesis and mrna splicing and add >10% new genes-most with human orthologs-to the biogenesis pathway, significantly extending our understanding of a universally conserved eukaryotic process.

lp+ss: siRNA knockdown of A20 slows tumor progression in an in vivo murine xenograft model. <s0> objective a20 is a tnf-inducible primary response gene, which has been found to have antiapoptotic function in several cancer cells. <s1> this study investigates a20 expression in human glioma tissues and four glioma cell lines, and its effect on tumorigenesis of glioma cells and a mouse tumor model.  <s2> methods human glioma tissue samples and cells were subject to reverse transcription-pcr (rt-pcr), western blotting and immunohistochemistry. <s3> glioma cells was tested by flow cytometry. <s4> a xenograft tumor model in mice was utilized to examine the knock-down effect of specific a20 sirnas on tumorigenesis.  <s5> results a20 was overexpressed in clinical glioma tissue samples (63.9%) and correlated with clinical staging. <s6> all four human glioma cell lines expressed a20, among which u87 displayed the strongest expression signals. <s7> inhibiting a20 expression by sirnas in vitro reduced the growth rates of glioma cells and resulted in g1/s arrest and increased apoptosis. <s8> in a mouse tumor model, local administration of sirna significantly suppressed solid tumor growth.  <s9> conclusions a20 was overexpressed both in human glioma tissues and cell lines, and inhibiting a20 expression greatly slowed tumor cell growth in culture and in mice. <s10> these findings indicated that a20 is involved in tumorigenesis of human glioma, and may serve as a future therapeutic target.

lp+ss: siRNA knockdown of A20 slows tumor progression in an in vivo murine xenograft model. <s0> prions are the protein-based infectious agents responsible for prion diseases. <s1> environmental prion contamination has been implicated in disease transmission. <s2> here, we analyzed the binding and retention of infectious prion protein (prp(sc)) to plants. <s3> small quantities of prp(sc) contained in diluted brain homogenate or in excretory materials (urine and feces) can bind to wheat grass roots and leaves. <s4> wild-type hamsters were efficiently infected by ingestion of prion-contaminated plants. <s5> the prion-plant interaction occurs with prions from diverse origins, including chronic wasting disease. <s6> furthermore, leaves contaminated by spraying with a prion-containing preparation retained prp(sc) for several weeks in the living plant. <s7> finally, plants can uptake prions from contaminated soil and transport them to aerial parts of the plant (stem and leaves). <s8> these findings demonstrate that plants can efficiently bind infectious prions and act as carriers of infectivity, suggesting a possible role of environmental prion contamination in the horizontal transmission of the disease. 
lp+ss: β-sheet opening occurs during pleurotolysin pore formation. <s0> membrane attack complex/perforin-like (macpf) proteins comprise the largest superfamily of pore-forming proteins, playing crucial roles in immunity and pathogenesis. <s1> soluble monomers assemble into large transmembrane pores via conformational transitions that remain to be structurally and mechanistically characterised. <s2> here we present an 11 å resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-em) structure of the two-part, fungal toxin pleurotolysin (ply), together with crystal structures of both components (the lipid binding plya protein and the pore-forming macpf component plyb). <s3> these data reveal a 13-fold pore 80 å in diameter and 100 å in height, with each subunit comprised of a plyb molecule atop a membrane bound dimer of plya. the resolution of the em map, together with biophysical and computational experiments, allowed confident assignment of subdomains in a macpf pore assembly. <s4> the major conformational changes in plyb are a ∼70° opening of the bent and distorted central β-sheet of the macpf domain, accompanied by extrusion and refolding of two α-helical regions into transmembrane β-hairpins (tmh1 and tmh2). <s5> we determined the structures of three different disulphide bond-trapped prepore intermediates. <s6> analysis of these data by molecular modelling and flexible fitting allows us to generate a potential trajectory of β-sheet unbending. <s7> the results suggest that macpf conformational change is triggered through disruption of the interface between a conserved helix-turn-helix motif and the top of tmh2. <s8> following their release we propose that the transmembrane regions assemble into β-hairpins via top down zippering of backbone hydrogen bonds to form the membrane-inserted β-barrel. <s9> the intermediate structures of the macpf domain during refolding into the β-barrel pore establish a structural paradigm for the transition from soluble monomer to pore, which may be conserved across the whole superfamily. <s10> the tmh2 region is critical for the release of both tmh clusters, suggesting why this region is targeted by endogenous inhibitors of macpf function.

lp+ss: β1/Ketel is able to bind microtubules. <s0> the microtubule (mt) cytoskeleton is required for many aspects of cell function, including the transport of intracellular materials, the maintenance of cell polarity, and the regulation of mitosis. <s1> these functions are coordinated by mt-associated proteins (maps), which work in concert with each other, binding mts and altering their properties. <s2> we have used a mt cosedimentation assay, combined with 1d and 2d page and mass spectrometry, to identify over 250 maps from early drosophila embryos. <s3> we have taken two complementary approaches to analyse the cellular function of novel maps isolated using this approach. <s4> first, we have carried out an rna interference (rnai) screen, identifying 21 previously uncharacterised genes involved in mt organisation. <s5> second, we have undertaken a bioinformatics analysis based on binary protein interaction data to produce putative interaction networks of maps. <s6> by combining both approaches, we have identified and validated map complexes with potentially important roles in cell cycle regulation and mitosis. <s7> this study therefore demonstrates that biologically relevant data can be harvested using such a multidisciplinary approach, and identifies new maps, many of which appear to be important in cell division. 
lp+ss: β1/Ketel is able to bind microtubules. <s0> the p446l mutant drosophila importin-beta (p446l-imp-beta) has been reported to prohibit-in dominant negative fashion-nuclear envelope (ne) assembly. <s1> along elucidating the mode of action of p446l-imp-beta we studied in vitro ne assembly on sepharose beads. <s2> while drosophila embryo extracts support ne assembly over sepharose beads coated with ran, ne assembly does not take place in extracts supplied with exogenous p446l-imp-beta. <s3> a ne also forms over importin-beta-coated beads. <s4> surprisingly, when immobilized to sepharose beads p446l-imp-beta as efficiently recruits ne vesicles as normal importin-beta. <s5> the discrepancy in behavior of cytoplasmic and bead-bound p446l-imp-beta appears to be related to icreased-as compared to normal importin-beta-microtubule (mt) binding ability of p446l-imp-beta. <s6> while wild-type importin-beta is able to bind mts and the binding decreases upon rangtp interaction, p446l-imp-beta cannot be removed from the mts by rangtp. <s7> p446l-imp-beta, like normal importin-beta, binds some types of the nucleoporins that have been known to be required for ne assembly at the end of mitosis. <s8> it appears that the inhibitory effect of p446l-imp-beta on ne assembly is caused by sequestering some of the nucleoporins required for ne assembly to the mts. 
lp+ss: β1/Ketel is able to bind microtubules. <s0> stiffness is a biophysical property of the extracellular matrix that modulates cellular functions, including proliferation, invasion, and differentiation, and it also may affect therapeutic responses. <s1> therapeutic durability in cancer treatments remains a problem for both chemotherapies and pathway-targeted drugs, but the reasons for this are not well understood. <s2> tumor progression is accompanied by changes in the biophysical properties of the tissue, and we asked whether matrix rigidity modulated the sensitive versus resistant states in her2-amplified breast cancer cell responses to the her2-targeted kinase inhibitor lapatinib. <s3> the antiproliferative effect of lapatinib was inversely proportional to the elastic modulus of the adhesive substrata. <s4> down-regulation of the mechanosensitive transcription coactivators yap and taz, either by sirna or with the small-molecule yap/tead inhibitor verteporfin, eliminated modulus-dependent lapatinib resistance. <s5> reduction of yap in vivo in mice also slowed the growth of implanted her2-amplified tumors, showing a trend of increasing sensitivity to lapatinib as yap decreased. <s6> thus we address the role of stiffness in resistance to and efficacy of a her2 pathway-targeted therapeutic via the mechanotransduction arm of the hippo pathway.
