<s> claim:A high microerythrocyte count protects against severe anemia in homozygous alpha (+)- thalassemia trait subjects. title: Increased Microerythrocyte Count in Homozygous α+-Thalassaemia Contributes to Protection against Severe Malarial Anaemia s0: background the heritable haemoglobinopathy alpha(+)-thalassaemia is caused by the reduced synthesis of alpha-globin chains that form part of normal adult haemoglobin (hb). s1: individuals homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia have microcytosis and an increased erythrocyte count. s2: alpha(+)-thalassaemia homozygosity confers considerable protection against severe malaria, including severe malarial anaemia (sma) (hb concentration < 50 g/l), but does not influence parasite count. s3: we tested the hypothesis that the erythrocyte indices associated with alpha(+)-thalassaemia homozygosity provide a haematological benefit during acute malaria.  s4: methods and findings data from children living on the north coast of papua new guinea who had participated in a case-control study of the protection afforded by alpha(+)-thalassaemia against severe malaria were reanalysed to assess the genotype-specific reduction in erythrocyte count and hb levels associated with acute malarial disease. s5: we observed a reduction in median erythrocyte count of approximately 1.5 x 10(12)/l in all children with acute falciparum malaria relative to values in community children (p < 0.001). s6: we developed a simple mathematical model of the linear relationship between hb concentration and erythrocyte count. s7: this model predicted that children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia lose less hb than children of normal genotype for a reduction in erythrocyte count of >1.1 x 10(12)/l as a result of the reduced mean cell hb in homozygous alpha(+)-thalassaemia. s8: in addition, children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia require a 10% greater reduction in erythrocyte count than children of normal genotype (p = 0.02) for hb concentration to fall to 50 g/l, the cutoff for sma. s9: we estimated that the haematological profile in children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia reduces the risk of sma during acute malaria compared to children of normal genotype (relative risk 0.52; 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.24-1.12, p = 0.09).  s10: conclusions the increased erythrocyte count and microcytosis in children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia may contribute substantially to their protection against sma. s11: a lower concentration of hb per erythrocyte and a larger population of erythrocytes may be a biologically advantageous strategy against the significant reduction in erythrocyte count that occurs during acute infection with the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum. s12: this haematological profile may reduce the risk of anaemia by other plasmodium species, as well as other causes of anaemia. s13: other host polymorphisms that induce an increased erythrocyte count and microcytosis may confer a similar advantage. 	true 1 9 10

<s> claim:A strong bias in the phage genome locations where the spacers were derived has been observed in many CRISPR subtypes that confer the immunity to phage. title: CRISPR adaptation biases explain preference for acquisition of foreign DNA s0: crispr-cas (clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats coupled with crispr-associated proteins) is a bacterial immunity system that protects against invading phages or plasmids. s1: in the process of crispr adaptation, short pieces of dna ('spacers') are acquired from foreign elements and integrated into the crispr array. s2: so far, it has remained a mystery how spacers are preferentially acquired from the foreign dna while the self chromosome is avoided. s3: here we show that spacer acquisition is replication-dependent, and that dna breaks formed at stalled replication forks promote spacer acquisition. s4: chromosomal hotspots of spacer acquisition were confined by chi sites, which are sequence octamers highly enriched on the bacterial chromosome, suggesting that these sites limit spacer acquisition from self dna. s5: we further show that the avoidance of self is mediated by the recbcd double-stranded dna break repair complex. s6: our results suggest that, in escherichia coli, acquisition of new spacers largely depends on recbcd-mediated processing of double-stranded dna breaks occurring primarily at replication forks, and that the preference for foreign dna is achieved through the higher density of chi sites on the self chromosome, in combination with the higher number of forks on the foreign dna. s7: this model explains the strong preference to acquire spacers both from high copy plasmids and from phages. 	unknown 
<s> claim:A strong bias in the phage genome locations where the spacers were derived has been observed in many CRISPR subtypes that confer the immunity to phage. title: Strong bias in the bacterial CRISPR elements that confer immunity to phage. s0: clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr)-cas systems provide adaptive immunity against phage via spacer-encoded crispr rnas that are complementary to invasive nucleic acids. s1: here, we challenge streptococcus thermophilus with a bacteriophage, and used pcr-based metagenomics to monitor phage-derived spacers daily for 15 days in two experiments. s2: spacers that target the host chromosome are infrequent and strongly selected against, suggesting autoimmunity is lethal. s3: in experiments that recover over half a million spacers, we observe early dominance by a few spacer sub-populations and rapid oscillations in sub-population abundances. s4: in two crispr systems and in replicate experiments, a few spacers account for the majority of spacer sequences. s5: nearly all phage locations targeted by the acquired spacers have a proto-spacer adjacent motif (pam), indicating pams are involved in spacer acquisition. s6: we detect a strong and reproducible bias in the phage genome locations from which spacers derive. s7: this may reflect selection for specific spacers based on location and effectiveness. 	true 6

<s> claim:Activation of PPM1D enhances p53 function. title: Exome sequencing identifies somatic gain-of-function PPM1D mutations in brainstem gliomas s0: gliomas arising in the brainstem and thalamus are devastating tumors that are difficult to surgically resect. s1: to determine the genetic and epigenetic landscape of these tumors, we performed exomic sequencing of 14 brainstem gliomas (bsgs) and 12 thalamic gliomas. s2: we also performed targeted mutational analysis of an additional 24 such tumors and genome-wide methylation profiling of 45 gliomas. s3: this study led to the discovery of tumor-specific mutations in ppm1d, encoding wild-type p53-induced protein phosphatase 1d (wip1), in 37.5% of the bsgs that harbored hallmark h3f3a mutations encoding p. s4: lys27met substitutions. s5: ppm1d mutations were mutually exclusive with tp53 mutations in bsg and attenuated p53 activation in vitro. s6: ppm1d mutations were truncating alterations in exon 6 that enhanced the ability of ppm1d to suppress the activation of the dna damage response checkpoint protein chk2. s7: these results define ppm1d as a frequent target of somatic mutation and as a potential therapeutic target in brainstem gliomas. 	false 5 6
<s> claim:Activation of PPM1D enhances p53 function. title: Mosaic PPM1D mutations are associated with predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer s0: improved sequencing technologies offer unprecedented opportunities for investigating the role of rare genetic variation in common disease. s1: however, there are considerable challenges with respect to study design, data analysis and replication. s2: using pooled next-generation sequencing of 507 genes implicated in the repair of dna in 1,150 samples, an analytical strategy focused on protein-truncating variants (ptvs) and a large-scale sequencing case–control replication experiment in 13,642 individuals, here we show that rare ptvs in the p53-inducible protein phosphatase ppm1d are associated with predisposition to breast cancer and ovarian cancer. s3: ppm1d ptv mutations were present in 25 out of 7,781 cases versus 1 out of 5,861 controls (p = 1.12 × 10−5), including 18 mutations in 6,912 individuals with breast cancer (p = 2.42 × 10−4) and 12 mutations in 1,121 individuals with ovarian cancer (p = 3.10 × 10−9). s4: notably, all of the identified ppm1d ptvs were mosaic in lymphocyte dna and clustered within a 370-base-pair region in the final exon of the gene, carboxy-terminal to the phosphatase catalytic domain. s5: functional studies demonstrate that the mutations result in enhanced suppression of p53 in response to ionizing radiation exposure, suggesting that the mutant alleles encode hyperactive ppm1d isoforms. s6: thus, although the mutations cause premature protein truncation, they do not result in the simple loss-of-function effect typically associated with this class of variant, but instead probably have a gain-of-function effect. s7: our results have implications for the detection and management of breast and ovarian cancer risk. s8: more generally, these data provide new insights into the role of rare and of mosaic genetic variants in common conditions, and the use of sequencing in their identification. 	false 5
<s> claim:Activation of the Rac1 homolog CED-10 kills viable cells in SRGP-1 mutant Caenorhabditis elegans. title: Loss of the RhoGAP SRGP-1 promotes the clearance of dead and injured cells in Caenorhabditis elegans s0: multicellular animals rapidly clear dying cells from their bodies. s1: many of the pathways that mediate this cell removal are conserved through evolution. s2: here, we identify srgp-1 as a negative regulator of cell clearance in both caenorhabditis elegans and mammalian cells. s3: loss of srgp-1 function results in improved engulfment of apoptotic cells, whereas srgp-1 overexpression inhibits apoptotic cell corpse removal. s4: we show that srgp-1 functions in engulfing cells and functions as a gtpase activating protein (gap) for ced-10 (rac1). s5: interestingly, loss of srgp-1 function promotes not only the clearance of already dead cells, but also the removal of cells that have been brought to the verge of death through sublethal apoptotic, necrotic or cytotoxic insults. s6: in contrast, impaired engulfment allows damaged cells to escape clearance, which results in increased long-term survival. s7: we propose that c. elegans uses the engulfment machinery as part of a primitive, but evolutionarily conserved, survey mechanism that identifies and removes unfit cells within a tissue. 	true 4 5
<s> claim:Activator-inhibitor pairs are provided ventrally by Xrl-sizzled. title: Regulation of ADMP and BMP2/4/7 at Opposite Embryonic Poles Generates a Self-Regulating Morphogenetic Field s0: embryos have the ability to self-regulate and regenerate normal structures after being sectioned in half. s1: how is such a morphogenetic field established? s2: we discovered that quadruple knockdown of admp and bmp2/4/7 in xenopus embryos eliminates self-regulation, causing ubiquitous neural induction throughout the ectoderm. s3: admp transcription in the spemann organizer is activated at low bmp levels. s4: when ventral bmp2/4/7 signals are depleted, admp expression increases, allowing for self-regulation. s5: admp has bmp-like activity and signals via the alk-2 receptor. s6: it is unable to signal dorsally because of inhibition by chordin. s7: the ventral bmp antagonists sizzled and bambi further refine the pattern. s8: by transplanting dorsal or ventral wild-type grafts into admp/bmp2/4/7-depleted hosts, we demonstrate that both poles serve as signaling centers that can induce histotypic differentiation over considerable distances. s9: we conclude that dorsal and ventral bmp signals and their extracellular antagonists expressed under opposing transcriptional regulation provide a molecular mechanism for embryonic self-regulation. 	unknown

<s> claim:An M2-like phenotype in brown adipose tissue macrophages is quickly induced by cold exposure. title: Alternatively activated macrophages produce catecholamines to sustain adaptive thermogenesis s0: all homeotherms use thermogenesis to maintain their core body temperature, ensuring that cellular functions and physiological processes can continue in cold environments. s1: in the prevailing model of thermogenesis, when the hypothalamus senses cold temperatures it triggers sympathetic discharge, resulting in the release of noradrenaline in brown adipose tissue and white adipose tissue. s2: acting via the β(3)-adrenergic receptors, noradrenaline induces lipolysis in white adipocytes, whereas it stimulates the expression of thermogenic genes, such as ppar-γ coactivator 1a (ppargc1a), uncoupling protein 1 (ucp1) and acyl-coa synthetase long-chain family member 1 (acsl1), in brown adipocytes. s3: however, the precise nature of all the cell types involved in this efferent loop is not well established. s4: here we report in mice an unexpected requirement for the interleukin-4 (il-4)-stimulated program of alternative macrophage activation in adaptive thermogenesis. s5: exposure to cold temperature rapidly promoted alternative activation of adipose tissue macrophages, which secrete catecholamines to induce thermogenic gene expression in brown adipose tissue and lipolysis in white adipose tissue. s6: absence of alternatively activated macrophages impaired metabolic adaptations to cold, whereas administration of il-4 increased thermogenic gene expression, fatty acid mobilization and energy expenditure, all in a macrophage-dependent manner. s7: thus, we have discovered a role for alternatively activated macrophages in the orchestration of an important mammalian stress response, the response to cold. 	true 5

<s> claim:Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are associated with decreased risk for functional renal insufficiency. title: Renal considerations in angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy: a statement for healthcare professionals from the Council on the Kidney in Cardiovascular Disease and the Council for High Blood Pressure Research of the American Heart Association. s0: angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors are now one of the most frequently used classes of antihypertensive drugs. s1: beyond their utility in the management of hypertension, their use has been extended to the long-term management of patients with congestive heart failure (chf), as well as diabetic and nondiabetic nephropathies. s2: although ace inhibitor therapy usually improves renal blood flow (rbf) and sodium excretion rates in chf and reduces the rate of progressive renal injury in chronic renal disease, its use can also be associated with a syndrome of "functional renal insufficiency" and/or hyperkalemia. s3: this form of acute renal failure (arf) most commonly develops shortly after initiation of ace inhibitor therapy but can be observed after months or years of therapy, even in the absence of prior ill effects. s4: arf is most likely to occur when renal perfusion pressure cannot be sustained because of substantial decreases in mean arterial pressure (map) or when glomerular filtration rate (gfr) is highly angiotensin ii (ang ii) dependent. s5: conditions that predict an adverse hemodynamic effect of ace inhibitors in patients with chf are preexisting hypotension and low cardiac filling pressures. s6: the gfr is especially dependent on ang ii during extracellular fluid (ecf) volume depletion, high-grade bilateral renal artery stenosis, or stenosis of a dominant or single kidney, as in a renal transplant recipient. s7: understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms and the common risk factors for ace inhibitor–induced functional arf is critical, because preventive strategies for arf exist, and if effectively used, they may permit use of these compounds in a less restricted fashion.   s8: under normal physiological conditions, renal autoregulation adjusts renal vascular resistance, so that rbf and gfr remain constant over a wide range of maps.1 the intrinsic renal autoregulation mechanism is adjusted by ang ii and the sympathetic nervous system. s9: when renal perfusion pressure falls (as in … 	false 2 7

<s> claim:B cells go though plasmablast differentiation and antibody production by continuous expression of EBI2. title: Guidance of B cells by the orphan G protein-coupled receptor EBI2 shapes humoral immune responses. s0: humoral immunity depends on both rapid and long-term antibody production against invading pathogens. s1: this is achieved by the generation of spatially distinct extrafollicular plasmablast and follicular germinal center (gc) b cell populations, but the signals that guide responding b cells to these alternative compartments have not been fully elucidated. s2: here, we show that expression of the orphan g protein-coupled receptor epstein-barr virus-induced gene 2 (ebi2, also known as gpr183) by activated b cells was essential for their movement to extrafollicular sites and induction of early plasmablast responses. s3: conversely, downregulation of ebi2 enabled b cells to access the center of follicles and promoted efficient gc formation. s4: ebi2 therefore provides a previously uncharacterized dimension to b cell migration that is crucial for coordinating rapid versus long-term antibody responses. 	true 2 4

<s> claim:Beta-band coherence is diminished for visible stimuli over invisible stimuli. title: Converging Intracranial Markers of Conscious Access s0: we compared conscious and nonconscious processing of briefly flashed words using a visual masking procedure while recording intracranial electroencephalogram (ieeg) in ten patients. s1: nonconscious processing of masked words was observed in multiple cortical areas, mostly within an early time window (<300 ms), accompanied by induced gamma-band activity, but without coherent long-distance neural activity, suggesting a quickly dissipating feedforward wave. s2: in contrast, conscious processing of unmasked words was characterized by the convergence of four distinct neurophysiological markers: sustained voltage changes, particularly in prefrontal cortex, large increases in spectral power in the gamma band, increases in long-distance phase synchrony in the beta range, and increases in long-range granger causality. s3: we argue that all of those measures provide distinct windows into the same distributed state of conscious processing. s4: these results have a direct impact on current theoretical discussions concerning the neural correlates of conscious access. 	unknown

<s> claim:BiP is a general endoplasmic reticulum stress marker. title: Wolfram syndrome 1 and adenylyl cyclase 8 interact at the plasma membrane to regulate insulin production and secretion s0: endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress causes pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and contributes to β-cell loss and the progression of type 2 diabetes. s1: wolfram syndrome 1 (wfs1) has been shown to be an important regulator of the er stress signalling pathway; however, its role in β-cell function remains unclear. s2: here we provide evidence that wfs1 is essential for glucose- and glucagon-like peptide 1 (glp-1)-stimulated cyclic amp production and regulation of insulin biosynthesis and secretion. s3: stimulation with glucose causes wfs1 translocation from the er to the plasma membrane, where it forms a complex with adenylyl cyclase 8 (ac8), an essential camp-generating enzyme in the β-cell that integrates glucose and glp-1 signalling. s4: er stress and mutant wfs1 inhibit complex formation and activation of ac8, reducing camp synthesis and insulin secretion. s5: these findings reveal that an er-stress-related protein has a distinct role outside the er regulating both insulin biosynthesis and secretion. s6: the reduction of wfs1 protein on the plasma membrane during er stress is a contributing factor for β-cell dysfunction and progression of type 2 diabetes. 	unknown 
<s> claim:Binding of p53 to enhancer regions (p53BERs) regulates the activity of p53 transcription and cell cycle arrest through the production of p53-dependent eRNAs. title: eRNAs are required for p53-dependent enhancer activity and gene transcription. s0: binding within or nearby target genes involved in cell proliferation and survival enables the p53 tumor suppressor gene to regulate their transcription and cell-cycle progression. s1: using genome-wide chromatin-binding profiles, we describe binding of p53 also to regions located distantly from any known p53 target gene. s2: interestingly, many of these regions possess conserved p53-binding sites and all known hallmarks of enhancer regions. s3: we demonstrate that these p53-bound enhancer regions (p53bers) indeed contain enhancer activity and interact intrachromosomally with multiple neighboring genes to convey long-distance p53-dependent transcription regulation. s4: furthermore, p53bers produce, in a p53-dependent manner, enhancer rnas (ernas) that are required for efficient transcriptional enhancement of interacting target genes and induction of a p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest. s5: thus, our results ascribe transcription enhancement activity to p53 with the capacity to regulate multiple genes from a single genomic binding site. s6: moreover, erna production from p53bers is required for efficient p53 transcription enhancement. 	true 4 6

<s> claim:Birth-weight is negatively associated with breast cancer. title: Role of birthweight in the etiology of breast cancer. s0: breast cancer may originate in utero. s1: we reviewed the available evidence on the association between birthweight and the risk of breast cancer. s2: to date, 26 research papers addressing this issue have been published. s3: the majority of studies identified a positive link between birthweight and premenopausal, but not postmenopausal, breast cancer. s4: the relative risk estimate for breast cancer comparing women with high birthweight to women with low birthweight combining all studies including both pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer was 1.23 (95% confidence interval 1.13-1.34). s5: the mechanisms underlying this association likely include elevated levels of growth factors that may increase the number of susceptible stem cells in the mammary gland or initiate tumors through dna mutations. s6: loss of imprinting (loi) of growth hormone genes relevant for intrauterine growth, such as insulin-like growth factor 2 (igf2), leads to abnormally high levels of these hormones evidenced by high birthweight. s7: loi of igf2 has also been found in mammary tumor tissue. s8: the role of environmental factors that stimulate such epigenetic regulation of gene expression remains to be elucidated. 	false 4

<s> claim:Birth-weight is negatively associated with breast cancer. title: Intrauterine environments and breast cancer risk: meta-analysis and systematic review s0: introduction various perinatal factors, including birth weight, birth order, maternal age, gestational age, twin status, and parental smoking, have been postulated to affect breast cancer risk in daughters by altering the hormonal environment of the developing fetal mammary glands. s1: despite ample biologic plausibility, epidemiologic studies to date have yielded conflicting results. s2: we investigated the associations between perinatal factors and subsequent breast cancer risk through meta-analyses.  s3: methods we reviewed breast cancer studies published from january 1966 to february 2007 that included data on birth weight, birth order, maternal age, gestational age, twin status, and maternal or paternal smoking. s4: meta-analyses using random effect models were employed to summarize the results.  s5: results we found that heavier birth weights were associated with increased breast cancer risk, with studies involving five categories of birth weight identifying odds ratios (ors) of 1.24 (95% confidence interval [ci] 1.04 to 1.48) for 4,000 g or more and 1.15 (95% ci 1.04 to 1.26) for 3,500 g to 3,999 g, relative to a birth weight of 2,500 to 2,599 g. these studies provided no support for a j-shaped relationship of birthweight to risk. s6: support for an association with birthweight was also derived from studies based on three birth weight categories (or 1.15 [95% ci 1.01 to 1.31] for > or =4,000 g relative to <3,000 g) and two birth weight categories (or 1.09 [95% ci 1.02 to 1.18] for > or =3,000 g relative to <3,000 g). s7: women born to older mothers and twins were also at some increased risk, but the results were heterogeneous across studies and publication years. s8: birth order, prematurity, and maternal smoking were unrelated to breast cancer risk.  s9: conclusion our findings provide some support for the hypothesis that in utero exposures reflective of higher endogenous hormone levels could affect risk for development of breast cancer in adulthood. 	false 5 9

<s> claim:Bone marrow cells don't contribute to adult macrophage compartments. title: Tissue-resident macrophages self-maintain locally throughout adult life with minimal contribution from circulating monocytes. s0: despite accumulating evidence suggesting local self-maintenance of tissue macrophages in the steady state, the dogma remains that tissue macrophages derive from monocytes. s1: using parabiosis and fate-mapping approaches, we confirmed that monocytes do not show significant contribution to tissue macrophages in the steady state. s2: similarly, we found that after depletion of lung macrophages, the majority of repopulation occurred by stochastic cellular proliferation in situ in a macrophage colony-stimulating factor (m-csf)- and granulocyte macrophage (gm)-csf-dependent manner but independently of interleukin-4. s3: we also found that after bone marrow transplantation, host macrophages retained the capacity to expand when the development of donor macrophages was compromised. s4: expansion of host macrophages was functional and prevented the development of alveolar proteinosis in mice transplanted with gm-csf-receptor-deficient progenitors. s5: collectively, these results indicate that tissue-resident macrophages and circulating monocytes should be classified as mononuclear phagocyte lineages that are independently maintained in the steady state. 	true 3

<s> claim:Chemical injury represses transglutaminase 2 activity. title: Transglutaminase 2 Undergoes a Large Conformational Change upon Activation  s0: human transglutaminase 2 (tg2), a member of a large family of enzymes that catalyze protein crosslinking, plays an important role in the extracellular matrix biology of many tissues and is implicated in the gluten-induced pathogenesis of celiac sprue. s1: although vertebrate transglutaminases have been studied extensively, thus far all structurally characterized members of this family have been crystallized in conformations with inaccessible active sites. s2: we have trapped human tg2 in complex with an inhibitor that mimics inflammatory gluten peptide substrates and have solved, at 2-a resolution, its x-ray crystal structure. s3: the inhibitor stabilizes tg2 in an extended conformation that is dramatically different from earlier transglutaminase structures. s4: the active site is exposed, revealing that catalysis takes place in a tunnel, bridged by two tryptophan residues that separate acyl-donor from acyl-acceptor and stabilize the tetrahedral reaction intermediates. s5: site-directed mutagenesis was used to investigate the acyl-acceptor side of the tunnel, yielding mutants with a marked increase in preference for hydrolysis over transamidation. s6: by providing the ability to visualize this activated conformer, our results create a foundation for understanding the catalytic as well as the non-catalytic roles of tg2 in biology, and for dissecting the process by which the autoantibody response to tg2 is induced in celiac sprue patients. 	unknown

<s> claim:Chronic HIV stimulation of B cells leads to the premature exhaustion of B cells. title: Antibody-Based HIV-1 Vaccines: Recent Developments and Future Directions s0: the global hiv vaccine enterprise convened a two-day workshop in may of 2007 to discuss humoral immune responses to hiv and approaches to design vaccines that induce viral neutralizing and other potentially protective antibody responses. s1: the goals of this workshop were to identify key scientific issues, gaps, and opportunities that have emerged since the enterprise strategic plan was first published in 2005 [1], and to make recommendations that enterprise stakeholders can use to plan new activities.  s2: most effective viral vaccines work, at least in part, by generating antibodies that inactivate or neutralize the invading virus, and the existing data strongly suggest that an optimally effective hiv-1 vaccine should elicit potent antiviral neutralizing antibodies. s3: however, unlike acute viral pathogens, hiv-1 chronically replicates in the host and evades the antibody response. s4: this immune evasion, along with the large genetic variation among hiv-1 strains worldwide, has posed major obstacles to vaccine development. s5: current hiv vaccine candidates do not elicit neutralizing antibodies against most circulating virus strains, and thus the induction of a protective antibody response remains a major priority for hiv-1 vaccine development. s6: for an antibody-based hiv-1 vaccine, progress in vaccine design is generally gauged by in vitro assays that measure the ability of vaccine-induced antibodies to neutralize a broad spectrum of viral isolates representing the major genetic subtypes (clades) of hiv-1 [2]. s7: although it is not known what magnitude and breadth of neutralization will predict protection in vaccine recipients, it is clear that current vaccine immunogens elicit antibodies that neutralize only a minority of circulating isolates. s8: thus, much progress needs to be made in this area. s9: also, though virus neutralization is considered a critical benchmark for a vaccine, this may not be the only benchmark for predicting success with antibody-based hiv-1 vaccine immunogens.  s10: the main targets for neutralizing antibodies to hiv-1 are the surface gp120 and trans-membrane gp41 envelope glycoproteins (env) that mediate receptor and coreceptor binding and the subsequent membrane fusion events that allow the virus to gain entry into cells [3]. s11: antibodies neutralize the virus by binding these viral spikes and blocking virus entry into susceptible cells, such as cd4+ t cells [4,5]. s12: in order to chronically replicate in the host, the virus exploits several mechanisms to shield itself against antibody recognition, including a dense outer coating of sugar molecules (n-linked glycans) and the strategic positioning of cysteine–cysteine loop structures on the gp120 molecule [6–8]. s13: these shielding mechanisms, although highly effective, have vulnerabilities imposed by fitness constraints. s14: information on the precise location and molecular structure of these vulnerable regions could be valuable for the rational design of improved vaccine immunogens.  s15: participants in the workshop identified four areas that, if given proper attention, could provide key information that would bring the field closer to an effective antibody-based hiv-1 vaccine: (1) structure-assisted immunogen design, (2) role of fc receptors and complement, (3) assay standardization and validation, and (4) immunoregulation of b cell responses. 	unknown 
<s> claim:Cis-acting lncRNAs control the expression of genes that are positioned in the vicinity of their transcription sites. title: Functional Consequences of Splicing of the Antisense Transcript COOLAIR on FLC Transcription s0: antisense transcription is widespread in many genomes; however, how much is functional is hotly debated. s1: we are investigating functionality of a set of long noncoding antisense transcripts, collectively called coolair, produced at arabidopsis flowering locus c (flc). s2: coolair initiates just downstream of the major sense transcript poly(a) site and terminates either early or extends into the flc promoter region. s3: we now show that splicing of coolair is functionally important. s4: this was revealed through analysis of a hypomorphic mutation in the core spliceosome component prp8. s5: the prp8 mutation perturbs a cotranscriptional feedback mechanism linking coolair processing to flc gene body histone demethylation and reduced flc transcription. s6: the importance of coolair splicing in this repression mechanism was confirmed by disrupting coolair production and mutating the coolair proximal splice acceptor site. s7: our findings suggest that altered splicing of a long noncoding transcript can quantitatively modulate gene expression through cotranscriptional coupling mechanisms. 	unknown 
<s> claim:Citrullinated proteins externalized in neutrophil extracellular traps act indirectly to disrupt the inflammatory cycle. title: NETs are a source of citrullinated autoantigens and stimulate inflammatory responses in rheumatoid arthritis. s0: the early events leading to the development of rheumatoid arthritis (ra) remain unclear, but formation of autoantibodies to citrullinated protein antigens (acpas) is considered a key pathogenic event. s1: neutrophils isolated from patients with various autoimmune diseases display enhanced neutrophil extracellular trap (net) formation, a phenomenon that exposes autoantigens in the context of immunostimulatory molecules. s2: we investigated whether aberrant netosis occurs in ra, determined its triggers, and examined its deleterious inflammatory consequences. s3: enhanced netosis was observed in circulating and ra synovial fluid neutrophils compared to neutrophils from healthy controls and from patients with osteoarthritis (oa). s4: further, netting neutrophils infiltrated ra synovial tissue, rheumatoid nodules, and skin. s5: netosis correlated with acpa presence and levels and with systemic inflammatory markers. s6: ra sera and immunoglobulin fractions from ra patients with high levels of acpa and/or rheumatoid factor significantly enhanced netosis, and the nets induced by these autoantibodies displayed distinct protein content. s7: indeed, during netosis, neutrophils externalized the citrullinated autoantigens implicated in ra pathogenesis, and anti-citrullinated vimentin antibodies potently induced net formation. s8: moreover, the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-17a (il-17a) and tumor necrosis factor-α (tnf-α) induced netosis in ra neutrophils. s9: in turn, nets significantly augmented inflammatory responses in ra and oa synovial fibroblasts, including induction of il-6, il-8, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. s10: these observations implicate accelerated netosis in ra pathogenesis, through externalization of citrullinated autoantigens and immunostimulatory molecules that may promote aberrant adaptive and innate immune responses in the joint and in the periphery, and perpetuate pathogenic mechanisms in this disease. 	false 7 9

<s> claim:Citrullinated proteins externalized in neutrophil extracellular traps act indirectly to disrupt the inflammatory cycle. title: Neutrophil extracellular chromatin traps connect innate immune response to autoimmunity s0: autoantibodies to dna and histones (chromatin) are the defining antigen specificity in systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) and related musculoskeletal disorders but the mechanisms responsible for their induction remain mysterious. s1: that situation rapidly changed once neutrophil extracellular chromatin traps (nets) were discovered and observed to play a conserved role in innate immune responses to a broad variety of microbial pathogens. s2: at the center of an infectious process, neutrophils exert various antimicrobial defenses, including the release of nuclear chromatin into the extracellular space. s3: the externalized nets, a complex meshwork of nuclear chromatin and antimicrobial proteins, serve to immobilize and degrade microbial pathogens. s4: here, we critically evaluate the evidence supporting nets versus apoptotic bodies as a source for nuclear antigens in autoimmunity. s5: we also discuss the possibility that net chromatin forms an essential component of immune deposits in the pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis in sle and other autoimmune immune complex diseases. 	unknown 
<s> claim:Citrullinated proteins externalized in neutrophil extracellular traps act indirectly to perpetuate the inflammatory cycle via induction of autoantibodies. title: NETs are a source of citrullinated autoantigens and stimulate inflammatory responses in rheumatoid arthritis. s0: the early events leading to the development of rheumatoid arthritis (ra) remain unclear, but formation of autoantibodies to citrullinated protein antigens (acpas) is considered a key pathogenic event. s1: neutrophils isolated from patients with various autoimmune diseases display enhanced neutrophil extracellular trap (net) formation, a phenomenon that exposes autoantigens in the context of immunostimulatory molecules. s2: we investigated whether aberrant netosis occurs in ra, determined its triggers, and examined its deleterious inflammatory consequences. s3: enhanced netosis was observed in circulating and ra synovial fluid neutrophils compared to neutrophils from healthy controls and from patients with osteoarthritis (oa). s4: further, netting neutrophils infiltrated ra synovial tissue, rheumatoid nodules, and skin. s5: netosis correlated with acpa presence and levels and with systemic inflammatory markers. s6: ra sera and immunoglobulin fractions from ra patients with high levels of acpa and/or rheumatoid factor significantly enhanced netosis, and the nets induced by these autoantibodies displayed distinct protein content. s7: indeed, during netosis, neutrophils externalized the citrullinated autoantigens implicated in ra pathogenesis, and anti-citrullinated vimentin antibodies potently induced net formation. s8: moreover, the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-17a (il-17a) and tumor necrosis factor-α (tnf-α) induced netosis in ra neutrophils. s9: in turn, nets significantly augmented inflammatory responses in ra and oa synovial fibroblasts, including induction of il-6, il-8, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. s10: these observations implicate accelerated netosis in ra pathogenesis, through externalization of citrullinated autoantigens and immunostimulatory molecules that may promote aberrant adaptive and innate immune responses in the joint and in the periphery, and perpetuate pathogenic mechanisms in this disease. 	true 7 8 9 10
<s> claim:Clathrin stabilizes the spindle fiber apparatus during mitosis. title: Clathrin is required for the function of the mitotic spindle s0: clathrin has an established function in the generation of vesicles that transfer membrane and proteins around the cell. s1: the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles occurs continuously in non-dividing cells, but is shut down during mitosis, when clathrin concentrates at the spindle apparatus. s2: here, we show that clathrin stabilizes fibres of the mitotic spindle to aid congression of chromosomes. s3: clathrin bound to the spindle directly by the amino-terminal domain of clathrin heavy chain. s4: depletion of clathrin heavy chain using rna interference prolonged mitosis; kinetochore fibres were destabilized, leading to defective congression of chromosomes to the metaphase plate and persistent activation of the spindle checkpoint. s5: normal mitosis was rescued by clathrin triskelia but not the n-terminal domain of clathrin heavy chain, indicating that stabilization of kinetochore fibres was dependent on the unique structure of clathrin. s6: the importance of clathrin for normal mitosis may be relevant to understanding human cancers that involve gene fusions of clathrin heavy chain. 	true 2 4 5
<s> claim:Cnn1 recruitment varies with cell cycle timing. title: Cnn1 inhibits the interactions between the KMN complexes of the yeast kinetochore s0: kinetochores attach the replicated chromosomes to the mitotic spindle and orchestrate their transmission to the daughter cells. s1: kinetochore–spindle binding and chromosome segregation are mediated by the multi-copy knl1spc105, mis12mtw1 and ndc80ndc80 complexes that form the so-called kmn network. s2: kmn–spindle attachment is regulated by the aurora bipl1 and mps1mps1 kinases. s3: it is unclear whether other mechanisms exist that support kmn activity during the cell cycle. s4: using budding yeast, we show that kinetochore protein cnn1 localizes to the base of the ndc80 complex and promotes a functionally competent configuration of the kmn network. s5: cnn1 regulates kmn activity in a spatiotemporal manner by inhibiting the interaction between its complexes. s6: cnn1 activity peaks in anaphase and is driven by the cdc28, mps1 and ipl1 kinases. 	true 5 6
<s> claim:Cognitive behavioral therapy is an ineffective treatment for insomnia title: Cognitive behavioral therapy vs zopiclone for treatment of chronic primary insomnia in older adults: a randomized controlled trial. s0: context insomnia is a common condition in older adults and is associated with a number of adverse medical, social, and psychological consequences. s1: previous research has suggested beneficial outcomes of both psychological and pharmacological treatments, but blinded placebo-controlled trials comparing the effects of these treatments are lacking.  s2: objective to examine short- and long-term clinical efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) and pharmacological treatment in older adults experiencing chronic primary insomnia.  s3: design, setting, and participants a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 46 adults (mean age, 60.8 y; 22 women) with chronic primary insomnia conducted between january 2004 and december 2005 in a single norwegian university-based outpatient clinic for adults and elderly patients.  s4: intervention cbt (sleep hygiene, sleep restriction, stimulus control, cognitive therapy, and relaxation; n = 18), sleep medication (7.5-mg zopiclone each night; n = 16), or placebo medication (n = 12). s5: all treatment duration was 6 weeks, and the 2 active treatments were followed up at 6 months.  s6: main outcome measures ambulant clinical polysomnographic data and sleep diaries were used to determine total wake time, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and slow-wave sleep (only assessed using polysomnography) on all 3 assessment points.  s7: results cbt resulted in improved short- and long-term outcomes compared with zopiclone on 3 out of 4 outcome measures. s8: for most outcomes, zopiclone did not differ from placebo. s9: participants receiving cbt improved their sleep efficiency from 81.4% at pretreatment to 90.1% at 6-month follow-up compared with a decrease from 82.3% to 81.9% in the zopiclone group. s10: participants in the cbt group spent much more time in slow-wave sleep (stages 3 and 4) compared with those in other groups, and spent less time awake during the night. s11: total sleep time was similar in all 3 groups; at 6 months, patients receiving cbt had better sleep efficiency using polysomnography than those taking zopiclone.  s12: conclusion these results suggest that interventions based on cbt are superior to zopiclone treatment both in short- and long-term management of insomnia in older adults.  s13: trial registration clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct00295386. 	false 7 9 10 12
<s> claim:Cognitive behavioral therapy is an ineffective treatment for insomnia title: A clinical approach to circadian rhythm sleep disorders. s0: circadian rhythm sleep disorders are characterized by complaints of insomnia and excessive sleepiness that are primarily due to alterations in the internal circadian timing system or a misalignment between the timing of sleep and the 24-h social and physical environment. s1: in addition to physiological and environmental factors, maladaptive behaviors often play an important role in the development of many of the circadian rhythm sleep disorders. s2: this review will focus on the clinical approach to the diagnosis and management of the various circadian rhythm sleep disorders, including delayed sleep phase disorder, advanced sleep phase disorder, non-entrained type, irregular sleep-wake rhythm, shift work sleep disorder and jet lag disorder. s3: diagnostic tools such as sleep diaries and wrist activity monitoring are often useful in confirming the diagnosis. s4: because behavioral and environmental factors often are involved in the development of these conditions, a multimodal approach is usually necessary. s5: interventions include sleep hygiene education, timed exposure to bright light as well as avoidance of bright light at the wrong time of the day and pharmacologic approaches, such as melatonin. s6: however, it should be noted that the use of melatonin is not an fda-approved indication for the treatment of circadian rhythm sleep disorders. 	unknown

<s> claim:Crossover hot spots are found within gene promoters in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. title: Mapping Meiotic Single-Strand DNA Reveals a New Landscape of DNA Double-Strand Breaks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae s0: dna double-strand breaks (dsbs), which are formed by the spo11 protein, initiate meiotic recombination. s1: previous dsb-mapping studies have used rad50s or sae2δ mutants, which are defective in break processing, to accumulate spo11-linked dsbs, and report large (≥ 50 kb) "dsb-hot" regions that are separated by "dsb-cold" domains of similar size. s2: substantial recombination occurs in some dsb-cold regions, suggesting that dsb patterns are not normal in rad50s or sae2δ mutants. s3: we therefore developed a novel method to map genome-wide, single-strand dna (ssdna)–associated dsbs that accumulate in processing-capable, repair-defective dmc1δ and dmc1δ rad51δ mutants. s4: dsbs were observed at known hot spots, but also in most previously identified "dsb-cold" regions, including near centromeres and telomeres. s5: although approximately 40% of the genome is dsb-cold in rad50s mutants, analysis of meiotic ssdna from dmc1δ shows that most of these regions have substantial dsb activity. s6: southern blot assays of dsbs in selected regions in dmc1δ, rad50s, and wild-type cells confirm these findings. s7: thus, dsbs are distributed much more uniformly than was previously believed. s8: comparisons of dsb signals in dmc1, dmc1 rad51, and dmc1 spo11 mutant strains identify dmc1 as a critical strand-exchange activity genome-wide, and confirm previous conclusions that spo11-induced lesions initiate all meiotic recombination. 	unknown 
<s> claim:Cyclin A2 destruction is necessary to switch from unstable to stable kt-mt attachments in mitosis. title: Cyclin A Regulates Kinetochore-Microtubules to Promote Faithful Chromosome Segregation s0: the most conspicuous event in the cell cycle is the alignment of chromosomes in metaphase. s1: chromosome alignment fosters faithful segregation through the formation of bi-oriented attachments of kinetochores to spindle microtubules. s2: notably, numerous kinetochore-microtubule (k-mt) attachment errors are present in early mitosis (prometaphase), and the persistence of those errors is the leading cause of chromosome mis-segregation in aneuploid human tumour cells that continually mis-segregate whole chromosomes and display chromosomal instability. s3: how robust error correction is achieved in prometaphase to ensure error-free mitosis remains unknown. s4: here we show that k-mt attachments in prometaphase cells are considerably less stable than in metaphase cells. s5: the switch to more stable k-mt attachments in metaphase requires the proteasome-dependent destruction of cyclin a in prometaphase. s6: persistent cyclin a expression prevents k-mt stabilization even in cells with aligned chromosomes. s7: by contrast, k-mts are prematurely stabilized in cyclin-a-deficient cells. s8: consequently, cells lacking cyclin a display higher rates of chromosome mis-segregation. s9: thus, the stability of k-mt attachments increases decisively in a coordinated fashion among all chromosomes as cells transit from prometaphase to metaphase. s10: cyclin a creates a cellular environment that promotes microtubule detachment from kinetochores in prometaphase to ensure efficient error correction and faithful chromosome segregation. 	true 5 6 7

<s> claim:Deregulation of HAND2 is a crucial step in endometrial carcinogenesis in mice. title: Role of DNA Methylation and Epigenetic Silencing of HAND2 in Endometrial Cancer Development s0: background endometrial cancer incidence is continuing to rise in the wake of the current ageing and obesity epidemics. s1: much of the risk for endometrial cancer development is influenced by the environment and lifestyle. s2: accumulating evidence suggests that the epigenome serves as the interface between the genome and the environment and that hypermethylation of stem cell polycomb group target genes is an epigenetic hallmark of cancer. s3: the objective of this study was to determine the functional role of epigenetic factors in endometrial cancer development.  s4: methods and findings epigenome-wide methylation analysis of >27,000 cpg sites in endometrial cancer tissue samples (n = 64) and control samples (n = 23) revealed that hand2 (a gene encoding a transcription factor expressed in the endometrial stroma) is one of the most commonly hypermethylated and silenced genes in endometrial cancer. s5: a novel integrative epigenome-transcriptome-interactome analysis further revealed that hand2 is the hub of the most highly ranked differential methylation hotspot in endometrial cancer. s6: these findings were validated using candidate gene methylation analysis in multiple clinical sample sets of tissue samples from a total of 272 additional women. s7: increased hand2 methylation was a feature of premalignant endometrial lesions and was seen to parallel a decrease in rna and protein levels. s8: furthermore, women with high endometrial hand2 methylation in their premalignant lesions were less likely to respond to progesterone treatment. s9: hand2 methylation analysis of endometrial secretions collected using high vaginal swabs taken from women with postmenopausal bleeding specifically identified those patients with early stage endometrial cancer with both high sensitivity and high specificity (receiver operating characteristics area under the curve = 0.91 for stage 1a and 0.97 for higher than stage 1a). s10: finally, mice harbouring a hand2 knock-out specifically in their endometrium were shown to develop precancerous endometrial lesions with increasing age, and these lesions also demonstrated a lack of pten expression.  s11: conclusions hand2 methylation is a common and crucial molecular alteration in endometrial cancer that could potentially be employed as a biomarker for early detection of endometrial cancer and as a predictor of treatment response. s12: the true clinical utility of hand2 dna methylation, however, requires further validation in prospective studies. s13: please see later in the article for the editors' summary. 	true 10

<s> claim:Drosophila supracellular actomyosin structures are found at boundaries in wing imaginal discs. title: Increased Cell Bond Tension Governs Cell Sorting at the Drosophila Anteroposterior Compartment Boundary s0: subdividing proliferating tissues into compartments is an evolutionarily conserved strategy of animal development [1-6]. s1: signals across boundaries between compartments can result in local expression of secreted proteins organizing growth and patterning of tissues [1-6]. s2: sharp and straight interfaces between compartments are crucial for stabilizing the position of such organizers and therefore for precise implementation of body plans. s3: maintaining boundaries in proliferating tissues requires mechanisms to counteract cell rearrangements caused by cell division; however, the nature of such mechanisms remains unclear. s4: here we quantitatively analyzed cell morphology and the response to the laser ablation of cell bonds in the vicinity of the anteroposterior compartment boundary in developing drosophila wings. s5: we found that mechanical tension is approximately 2.5-fold increased on cell bonds along this compartment boundary as compared to the remaining tissue. s6: cell bond tension is decreased in the presence of y-27632 [7], an inhibitor of rho-kinase whose main effector is myosin ii [8]. s7: simulations using a vertex model [9] demonstrate that a 2.5-fold increase in local cell bond tension suffices to guide the rearrangement of cells after cell division to maintain compartment boundaries. s8: our results provide a physical mechanism in which the local increase in myosin ii-dependent cell bond tension directs cell sorting at compartment boundaries. 	true 8
<s> claim:Drosophila supracellular actomyosin structures are found at boundaries in wing imaginal discs. title: Localization and requirement for Myosin II at the dorsal-ventral compartment boundary of the Drosophila wing. s0: as organisms develop, their tissues can become separated into distinct cell populations through the establishment of compartment boundaries. s1: compartment boundaries have been discovered in a wide variety of tissues, but in many cases the molecular mechanisms that separate cells remain poorly understood. s2: in the drosophila wing, a stripe of notch activation maintains the dorsal-ventral compartment boundary, through a process that depends on the actin cytoskeleton. s3: here, we show that the dorsal-ventral boundary exhibits a distinct accumulation of myosin ii, and that this accumulation is regulated downstream of notch signaling. s4: conversely, the dorsal-ventral boundary is depleted for the par-3 homologue bazooka. s5: we further show that mutations in the myosin heavy chain subunit encoded by zipper can impair dorsal-ventral compartmentalization without affecting anterior-posterior compartmentalization. s6: these observations identify a distinct accumulation and requirement for myosin activity in dorsal-ventral compartmentalization, and suggest a novel mechanism in which contractile tension along an f-actin cable at the compartment boundary contributes to compartmentalization. 	true 3

<s> claim:Eilat virus (EILV) produced in mosquitos elicits rapid and long-lasting neutralizing antibodies in nonhuman primates. title: A chikungunya fever vaccine utilizing an insect-specific virus platform s0: traditionally, vaccine development involves tradeoffs between immunogenicity and safety. s1: live-attenuated vaccines typically offer rapid and durable immunity but have reduced safety when compared to inactivated vaccines. s2: in contrast, the inability of inactivated vaccines to replicate enhances safety at the expense of immunogenicity, often necessitating multiple doses and boosters. s3: to overcome these tradeoffs, we developed the insect-specific alphavirus, eilat virus (eilv), as a vaccine platform. s4: to address the chikungunya fever (chikf) pandemic, we used an eilv cdna clone to design a chimeric virus containing the chikungunya virus (chikv) structural proteins. s5: the recombinant eilv/chikv was structurally identical at 10 å to wild-type chikv, as determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, and it mimicked the early stages of chikv replication in vertebrate cells from attachment and entry to viral rna delivery. s6: yet the recombinant virus remained completely defective for productive replication, providing a high degree of safety. s7: a single dose of eilv/chikv produced in mosquito cells elicited rapid (within 4 d) and long-lasting (>290 d) neutralizing antibodies that provided complete protection in two different mouse models. s8: in nonhuman primates, eilv/chikv elicited rapid and robust immunity that protected against viremia and telemetrically monitored fever. s9: our eilv platform represents the first structurally native application of an insect-specific virus in preclinical vaccine development and highlights the potential application of such viruses in vaccinology. 	true 7 8

<s> claim:Eliminating the last sporadic cases of malaria requires considerable funding. title: Costs and financial feasibility of malaria elimination s0: the marginal costs and benefits of converting malaria programmes from a control to an elimination goal are central to strategic decisions, but empirical evidence is scarce. s1: we present a conceptual framework to assess the economics of elimination and analyse a central component of that framework-potential short-term to medium-term financial savings. s2: after a review that showed a dearth of existing evidence, the net present value of elimination in five sites was calculated and compared with effective control. s3: the probability that elimination would be cost-saving over 50 years ranged from 0% to 42%, with only one site achieving cost-savings in the base case. s4: these findings show that financial savings should not be a primary rationale for elimination, but that elimination might still be a worthy investment if total benefits are sufficient to outweigh marginal costs. s5: robust research into these elimination benefits is urgently needed. 	unknown 
<s> claim:Emodin forms hydrogen bonds with residues involved in PGAM1 substrate binding. title: Tyr26 phosphorylation of PGAM1 provides a metabolic advantage to tumours by stabilizing the active conformation s0: how oncogenic signalling coordinates glycolysis and anabolic biosynthesis in cancer cells remains unclear. s1: we recently reported that the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (pgam1) regulates anabolic biosynthesis by controlling intracellular levels of its substrate 3-phosphoglycerate and product 2-phosphoglycerate. s2: here we report a novel mechanism in which y26 phosphorylation enhances pgam1 activation through release of inhibitory e19 that blocks the active site, stabilising cofactor 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate binding and h11 phosphorylation. s3: we also report the crystal structure of h11-phosphorylated pgam1 and find that phospho-h11 activates pgam1 at least in part by promoting substrate 3-phosphoglycerate binding. s4: moreover, y26 phosphorylation of pgam1 is common in human cancer cells and contributes to regulation of 3-phosphoglycerate and 2-phosphoglycerate levels, promoting cancer cell proliferation and tumour growth. s5: as pgam1 is a negative transcriptional target of tp53, and is therefore commonly upregulated in human cancers, these findings suggest that y26 phosphorylation represents an additional acute mechanism underlying phosphoglycerate mutase 1 upregulation. 	unknown 
<s> claim:Energy balance requires hypothalamic glutamate neurotransmission. title: Glutamate mediates the function of melanocortin receptor 4 on Sim1 neurons in body weight regulation. s0: the melanocortin receptor 4 (mc4r) is a well-established mediator of body weight homeostasis. s1: however, the neurotransmitter(s) that mediate mc4r function remain largely unknown; as a result, little is known about the second-order neurons of the mc4r neural pathway. s2: single-minded 1 (sim1)-expressing brain regions, which include the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (pvh), represent key brain sites that mediate melanocortin action. s3: we conditionally restored mc4r expression in sim1 neurons in the background of mc4r-null mice. s4: the restoration dramatically reduced obesity in mc4r-null mice. s5: the anti-obesity effect was completely reversed by selective disruption of glutamate release from those same sim1 neurons. s6: the reversal was caused by lower energy expenditure and hyperphagia. s7: corroboratively, selective disruption of glutamate release from adult pvh neurons led to rapid obesity development via reduced energy expenditure and hyperphagia. s8: thus, this study establishes glutamate as the primary neurotransmitter that mediates mc4rs on sim1 neurons in body weight regulation. 	true 5 7 8
<s> claim:Energy balance requires hypothalamic glutamate neurotransmission. title: Fasting Activation of AgRP Neurons Requires NMDA Receptors and Involves Spinogenesis and Increased Excitatory Tone s0: agrp neuron activity drives feeding and weight gain whereas that of nearby pomc neurons does the opposite. s1: however, the role of excitatory glutamatergic input in controlling these neurons is unknown. s2: to address this question, we generated mice lacking nmda receptors (nmdars) on either agrp or pomc neurons. s3: deletion of nmdars from agrp neurons markedly reduced weight, body fat and food intake whereas deletion from pomc neurons had no effect. s4: activation of agrp neurons by fasting, as assessed by c-fos, agrp and npy mrna expression, ampa receptor-mediated epscs, depolarization and firing rates, required nmdars. s5: furthermore, agrp but not pomc neurons have dendritic spines and increased glutamatergic input onto agrp neurons caused by fasting was paralleled by an increase in spines, suggesting fasting induced synaptogenesis and spinogenesis. s6: thus glutamatergic synaptic transmission and its modulation by nmdars play key roles in controlling agrp neurons and determining the cellular and behavioral response to fasting. 	true 3 4 5 6
<s> claim:Energy balance requires hypothalamic glutamate neurotransmission. title: Synaptic glutamate release by ventromedial hypothalamic neurons is part of the neurocircuitry that prevents hypoglycemia. s0: the importance of neuropeptides in the hypothalamus has been experimentally established. s1: due to difficulties in assessing function in vivo, the roles of the fast-acting neurotransmitters glutamate and gaba are largely unknown. s2: synaptic vesicular transporters (vgluts for glutamate and vgat for gaba) are required for vesicular uptake and, consequently, synaptic release of neurotransmitters. s3: ventromedial hypothalamic (vmh) neurons are predominantly glutamatergic and express vglut2. s4: to evaluate the role of glutamate release from vmh neurons, we generated mice lacking vglut2 selectively in sf1 neurons (a major subset of vmh neurons). s5: these mice have hypoglycemia during fasting secondary to impaired fasting-induced increases in the glucose-raising pancreatic hormone glucagon and impaired induction in liver of mrnas encoding pgc-1alpha and the gluconeogenic enzymes pepck and g6pase. s6: similarly, these mice have defective counterregulatory responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and 2-deoxyglucose (an antimetabolite). s7: thus, glutamate release from vmh neurons is an important component of the neurocircuitry that functions to prevent hypoglycemia. 	true 7
<s> claim:Energy balance requires hypothalamic glutamate neurotransmission. title: Topographic mapping of VMH → arcuate nucleus microcircuits and their reorganization by fasting s0: in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (arc), pro-opiomelanocortin (pomc) neurons inhibit feeding and neuropeptide-y (npy) neurons stimulate feeding. s1: we tested whether neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (vmh), a known satiety center, activate anorexigenic neuronal pathways in the arc by projecting either excitatory synaptic inputs to pomc neurons and/or inhibitory inputs to npy neurons. s2: using laser scanning photostimulation in brain slices from transgenic mice, we found that pomc and npy neurons, which are interspersed in the arc, are nevertheless regulated by anatomically distinct synaptic inputs. s3: pomc neurons received strong excitatory input from the medial vmh (mvmh), whereas npy neurons did not and, instead, received weak inhibitory input only from within the arc. s4: the strength of the excitatory input from the mvmh to pomc neurons was diminished by fasting. s5: these data identify a new molecularly defined circuit that is dynamically regulated by nutritional state in a manner consistent with the known role of the vmh as a satiety center. 	unknown 
<s> claim:Energy balance requires hypothalamic glutamate neurotransmission. title: Leptin regulates glutamate and glucose transporters in hypothalamic astrocytes. s0: glial cells perform critical functions that alter the metabolism and activity of neurons, and there is increasing interest in their role in appetite and energy balance. s1: leptin, a key regulator of appetite and metabolism, has previously been reported to influence glial structural proteins and morphology. s2: here, we demonstrate that metabolic status and leptin also modify astrocyte-specific glutamate and glucose transporters, indicating that metabolic signals influence synaptic efficacy and glucose uptake and, ultimately, neuronal function. s3: we found that basal and glucose-stimulated electrical activity of hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (pomc) neurons in mice were altered in the offspring of mothers fed a high-fat diet. s4: in adulthood, increased body weight and fasting also altered the expression of glucose and glutamate transporters. s5: these results demonstrate that whole-organism metabolism alters hypothalamic glial cell activity and suggest that these cells play an important role in the pathology of obesity. 	true 2 3 4
<s> claim:Enhanced early production of inflammatory chemokines damages viral control in the lung. title: Memory CD4+ T cells induce innate responses independently of pathogen s0: inflammation induced by recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns markedly affects subsequent adaptive responses. s1: we asked whether the adaptive immune system can also affect the character and magnitude of innate inflammatory responses. s2: we found that the response of memory, but not naive, cd4+ t cells enhances production of multiple innate inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (iics) in the lung and that, during influenza infection, this leads to early control of virus. s3: memory cd4+ t cell–induced iics and viral control require cognate antigen recognition and are optimal when memory cells are either t helper type 1 (th1) or th17 polarized but are independent of interferon-γ (ifn-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (tnf-α) production and do not require activation of conserved pathogen recognition pathways. s4: this represents a previously undescribed mechanism by which memory cd4+ t cells induce an early innate response that enhances immune protection against pathogens. 	false 2

<s> claim:Exhaustion of B cells contributes to poor Ab response in HIV-infected individuals. title: Antibody-Based HIV-1 Vaccines: Recent Developments and Future Directions s0: the global hiv vaccine enterprise convened a two-day workshop in may of 2007 to discuss humoral immune responses to hiv and approaches to design vaccines that induce viral neutralizing and other potentially protective antibody responses. s1: the goals of this workshop were to identify key scientific issues, gaps, and opportunities that have emerged since the enterprise strategic plan was first published in 2005 [1], and to make recommendations that enterprise stakeholders can use to plan new activities.  s2: most effective viral vaccines work, at least in part, by generating antibodies that inactivate or neutralize the invading virus, and the existing data strongly suggest that an optimally effective hiv-1 vaccine should elicit potent antiviral neutralizing antibodies. s3: however, unlike acute viral pathogens, hiv-1 chronically replicates in the host and evades the antibody response. s4: this immune evasion, along with the large genetic variation among hiv-1 strains worldwide, has posed major obstacles to vaccine development. s5: current hiv vaccine candidates do not elicit neutralizing antibodies against most circulating virus strains, and thus the induction of a protective antibody response remains a major priority for hiv-1 vaccine development. s6: for an antibody-based hiv-1 vaccine, progress in vaccine design is generally gauged by in vitro assays that measure the ability of vaccine-induced antibodies to neutralize a broad spectrum of viral isolates representing the major genetic subtypes (clades) of hiv-1 [2]. s7: although it is not known what magnitude and breadth of neutralization will predict protection in vaccine recipients, it is clear that current vaccine immunogens elicit antibodies that neutralize only a minority of circulating isolates. s8: thus, much progress needs to be made in this area. s9: also, though virus neutralization is considered a critical benchmark for a vaccine, this may not be the only benchmark for predicting success with antibody-based hiv-1 vaccine immunogens.  s10: the main targets for neutralizing antibodies to hiv-1 are the surface gp120 and trans-membrane gp41 envelope glycoproteins (env) that mediate receptor and coreceptor binding and the subsequent membrane fusion events that allow the virus to gain entry into cells [3]. s11: antibodies neutralize the virus by binding these viral spikes and blocking virus entry into susceptible cells, such as cd4+ t cells [4,5]. s12: in order to chronically replicate in the host, the virus exploits several mechanisms to shield itself against antibody recognition, including a dense outer coating of sugar molecules (n-linked glycans) and the strategic positioning of cysteine–cysteine loop structures on the gp120 molecule [6–8]. s13: these shielding mechanisms, although highly effective, have vulnerabilities imposed by fitness constraints. s14: information on the precise location and molecular structure of these vulnerable regions could be valuable for the rational design of improved vaccine immunogens.  s15: participants in the workshop identified four areas that, if given proper attention, could provide key information that would bring the field closer to an effective antibody-based hiv-1 vaccine: (1) structure-assisted immunogen design, (2) role of fc receptors and complement, (3) assay standardization and validation, and (4) immunoregulation of b cell responses. 	unknown 
<s> claim:Exposure to fine particulate air pollution is unrelated to anxiety prevalence. title: The relation between past exposure to fine particulate air pollution and prevalent anxiety: observational cohort study s0: objective to determine whether higher past exposure to particulate air pollution is associated with prevalent high symptoms of anxiety.  s1: design observational cohort study.  s2: setting nurses' health study.  s3: participants 71,271 women enrolled in the nurses' health study residing throughout the contiguous united states who had valid estimates on exposure to particulate matter for at least one exposure period of interest and data on anxiety symptoms.  s4: main outcome measures meaningfully high symptoms of anxiety, defined as a score of 6 points or greater on the phobic anxiety subscale of the crown-crisp index, administered in 2004.  s5: results the 71,271 eligible women were aged between 57 and 85 years (mean 70 years) at the time of assessment of anxiety symptoms, with a prevalence of high anxiety symptoms of 15%. s6: exposure to particulate matter was characterized using estimated average exposure to particulate matter <2.5 μm in diameter (pm2.5) and 2.5 to 10 μm in diameter (pm2.5-10) in the one month, three months, six months, one year, and 15 years prior to assessment of anxiety symptoms, and residential distance to the nearest major road two years prior to assessment. s7: significantly increased odds of high anxiety symptoms were observed with higher exposure to pm2.5 for multiple averaging periods (for example, odds ratio per 10 µg/m(3) increase in prior one month average pm2.5: 1.12, 95% confidence interval 1.06 to 1.19; in prior 12 month average pm2.5: 1.15, 1.06 to 1.26). s8: models including multiple exposure windows suggested short term averaging periods were more relevant than long term averaging periods. s9: there was no association between anxiety and exposure to pm2.5-10. s10: residential proximity to major roads was not related to anxiety symptoms in a dose dependent manner.  s11: conclusions exposure to fine particulate matter (pm2.5) was associated with high symptoms of anxiety, with more recent exposures potentially more relevant than more distant exposures. s12: research evaluating whether reductions in exposure to ambient pm2.5 would reduce the population level burden of clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety is warranted. 	false 7 11
<s> claim:Expression of MSX2 is induced 3 hours after the addition of BMP4, which is earlier than T and CDX2. title: BRACHYURY and CDX2 Mediate BMP-Induced Differentiation of Human and Mouse Pluripotent Stem Cells into Embryonic and Extraembryonic Lineages s0: bmp is thought to induce hesc differentiation toward multiple lineages including mesoderm and trophoblast. s1: the bmp-induced trophoblast phenotype is a long-standing paradox in stem cell biology. s2: here we readdressed bmp function in hescs and mouse epiblast-derived cells. s3: we found that bmp4 cooperates with fgf2 (via erk) to induce mesoderm and to inhibit endoderm differentiation. s4: these conditions induced cells with high levels of brachyury (bra) that coexpressed cdx2. s5: bra was necessary for and preceded cdx2 expression; both genes were essential for expression not only of mesodermal genes but also of trophoblast-associated genes. s6: maximal expression of the latter was seen in the absence of fgf but these cells coexpressed mesodermal genes and moreover they differed in cell surface and epigenetic properties from placental trophoblast. s7: we conclude that bmp induces human and mouse pluripotent stem cells primarily to form mesoderm, rather than trophoblast, acting through bra and cdx2. 	unknown

<s> claim:Fibroblast growth factor 21 protects against atherosclerosis by modulating adiponectin and SREBP2 levels. title: Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 Prevents Atherosclerosis by Suppression of Hepatic Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein-2 and Induction of Adiponectin in Mice s0: background fibroblast growth factor 21 (fgf21) is a metabolic hormone with pleiotropic effects on glucose and lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity. s1: it acts as a key downstream target of both peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and γ, the agonists of which have been used for lipid lowering and insulin sensitization, respectively. s2: however, the role of fgf21 in the cardiovascular system remains elusive.  s3: methods and results the roles of fgf21 in atherosclerosis were investigated by evaluating the impact of fgf21 deficiency and replenishment with recombinant fgf21 in apolipoprotein e(-/-) mice. s4: fgf21 deficiency causes a marked exacerbation of atherosclerotic plaque formation and premature death in apolipoprotein e(-/-) mice, which is accompanied by hypoadiponectinemia and severe hypercholesterolemia. s5: replenishment of fgf21 protects against atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein e(-/-)mice via 2 independent mechanisms, inducing the adipocyte production of adiponectin, which in turn acts on the blood vessels to inhibit neointima formation and macrophage inflammation, and suppressing the hepatic expression of the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2, thereby leading to reduced cholesterol synthesis and attenuation of hypercholesterolemia. s6: chronic treatment with adiponectin partially reverses atherosclerosis without obvious effects on hypercholesterolemia in fgf21-deficient apolipoprotein e(-/-) mice. s7: by contrast, the cholesterol-lowering effects of fgf21 are abrogated by hepatic expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2.  s8: conclusions fgf21 protects against atherosclerosis via fine tuning the multiorgan crosstalk among liver, adipose tissue, and blood vessels. 	true 5
<s> claim:Flexible molecules experience less steric hindrance in the tumor microenviroment than rigid molecules. title: Quantum dots spectrally distinguish multiple species within the tumor milieu in vivo s0: a solid tumor is an organ composed of cancer and host cells embedded in an extracellular matrix and nourished by blood vessels. s1: a prerequisite to understanding tumor pathophysiology is the ability to distinguish and monitor each component in dynamic studies. s2: standard fluorophores hamper simultaneous intravital imaging of these components. s3: here, we used multiphoton microscopy techniques and transgenic mice that expressed green fluorescent protein, and combined them with the use of quantum dot preparations. s4: we show that these fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystals can be customized to concurrently image and differentiate tumor vessels from both the perivascular cells and the matrix. s5: moreover, we used them to measure the ability of particles of different sizes to access the tumor. s6: finally, we successfully monitored the recruitment of quantum dot–labeled bone marrow–derived precursor cells to the tumor vasculature. s7: these examples show the versatility of quantum dots for studying tumor pathophysiology and creating avenues for treatment. 	unknown 
<s> claim:Folate and vitamin B12 levels influence the association between homocysteine and preeclampsia. title: Effect modification by population dietary folate on the association between MTHFR genotype, homocysteine, and stroke risk: a meta-analysis of genetic studies and randomised trials s0: background the mthfr 677c→t polymorphism has been associated with raised homocysteine concentration and increased risk of stroke. s1: a previous overview showed that the effects were greatest in regions with low dietary folate consumption, but differentiation between the effect of folate and small-study bias was difficult. s2: a meta-analysis of randomised trials of homocysteine-lowering interventions showed no reduction in coronary heart disease events or stroke, but the trials were generally set in populations with high folate consumption. s3: we aimed to reduce the effect of small-study bias and investigate whether folate status modifies the association between mthfr 677c→t and stroke in a genetic analysis and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.  s4: methods we established a collaboration of genetic studies consisting of 237 datasets including 59,995 individuals with data for homocysteine and 20,885 stroke events. s5: we compared the genetic findings with a meta-analysis of 13 randomised trials of homocysteine-lowering treatments and stroke risk (45,549 individuals, 2314 stroke events, 269 transient ischaemic attacks).  s6: findings the effect of the mthfr 677c→t variant on homocysteine concentration was larger in low folate regions (asia; difference between individuals with tt versus cc genotype, 3·12 μmol/l, 95% ci 2·23 to 4·01) than in areas with folate fortification (america, australia, and new zealand, high; 0·13 μmol/l, -0·85 to 1·11). s7: the odds ratio (or) for stroke was also higher in asia (1·68, 95% ci 1·44 to 1·97) than in america, australia, and new zealand, high (1·03, 0·84 to 1·25). s8: most randomised trials took place in regions with high or increasing population folate concentrations. s9: the summary relative risk (rr) of stroke in trials of homocysteine-lowering interventions (0·94, 95% ci 0·85 to 1·04) was similar to that predicted for the same extent of homocysteine reduction in large genetic studies in populations with similar folate status (predicted rr 1·00, 95% ci 0·90 to 1·11). s10: although the predicted effect of homocysteine reduction from large genetic studies in low folate regions (asia) was larger (rr 0·78, 95% ci 0·68 to 0·90), no trial has evaluated the effect of lowering of homocysteine on stroke risk exclusively in a low folate region.  s11: interpretation in regions with increasing levels or established policies of population folate supplementation, evidence from genetic studies and randomised trials is concordant in suggesting an absence of benefit from lowering of homocysteine for prevention of stroke. s12: further large-scale genetic studies of the association between mthfr 677c→t and stroke in low folate settings are needed to distinguish effect modification by folate from small-study bias. s13: if future randomised trials of homocysteine-lowering interventions for stroke prevention are undertaken, they should take place in regions with low folate consumption.  s14: funding full funding sources listed at end of paper (see acknowledgments). 	unknown

<s> claim:FoxO3a activation in neuronal death is inhibited by reactive oxygen species (ROS). title: Stress-dependent regulation of FOXO transcription factors by the SIRT1 deacetylase. s0: the sir2 deacetylase modulates organismal life-span in various species. s1: however, the molecular mechanisms by which sir2 increases longevity are largely unknown. s2: we show that in mammalian cells, the sir2 homolog sirt1 appears to control the cellular response to stress by regulating the foxo family of forkhead transcription factors, a family of proteins that function as sensors of the insulin signaling pathway and as regulators of organismal longevity. s3: sirt1 and the foxo transcription factor foxo3 formed a complex in cells in response to oxidative stress, and sirt1 deacetylated foxo3 in vitro and within cells. s4: sirt1 had a dual effect on foxo3 function: sirt1 increased foxo3's ability to induce cell cycle arrest and resistance to oxidative stress but inhibited foxo3's ability to induce cell death. s5: thus, one way in which members of the sir2 family of proteins may increase organismal longevity is by tipping foxo-dependent responses away from apoptosis and toward stress resistance. 	false 5
<s> claim:Foxk2 regulates autophagy genes in muscle cells and fibroblast cells. title: Foxk proteins repress the initiation of starvation-induced atrophy and autophagy programs s0: autophagy is the primary catabolic process triggered in response to starvation. s1: although autophagic regulation within the cytosolic compartment is well established, it is becoming clear that nuclear events also regulate the induction or repression of autophagy. s2: nevertheless, a thorough understanding of the mechanisms by which sequence-specific transcription factors modulate expression of genes required for autophagy is lacking. s3: here, we identify foxk proteins (foxk1 and foxk2) as transcriptional repressors of autophagy in muscle cells and fibroblasts. s4: interestingly, foxk1/2 serve to counter-balance another forkhead transcription factor, foxo3, which induces an overlapping set of autophagic and atrophic targets in muscle. s5: foxk1/2 specifically recruits sin3a-hdac complexes to restrict acetylation of histone h4 and expression of critical autophagy genes. s6: remarkably, mtor promotes the transcriptional activity of foxk1 by facilitating nuclear entry to specifically limit basal levels of autophagy in nutrient-rich conditions. s7: our study highlights an ancient, conserved mechanism whereby nutritional status is interpreted by mtor to restrict autophagy by repressing essential autophagy genes through foxk-sin3-mediated transcriptional control. 	true 3 5

<s> claim:Genes involved in pre-mRNA splicing have a significant impact on genome stability. title: A genome-wide siRNA screen reveals diverse cellular processes and pathways that mediate genome stability. s0: signaling pathways that respond to dna damage are essential for the maintenance of genome stability and are linked to many diseases, including cancer. s1: here, a genome-wide sirna screen was employed to identify additional genes involved in genome stabilization by monitoring phosphorylation of the histone variant h2ax, an early mark of dna damage. s2: we identified hundreds of genes whose downregulation led to elevated levels of h2ax phosphorylation (gammah2ax) and revealed links to cellular complexes and to genes with unclassified functions. s3: we demonstrate a widespread role for mrna-processing factors in preventing dna damage, which in some cases is caused by aberrant rna-dna structures. s4: furthermore, we connect increased gammah2ax levels to the neurological disorder charcot-marie-tooth (cmt) syndrome, and we find a role for several cmt proteins in the dna-damage response. s5: these data indicate that preservation of genome stability is mediated by a larger network of biological processes than previously appreciated. 	true 3
<s> claim:Genes regulated by Esrrb transcription factor are sensitive to Mbd3 function. title: An Oct4-Centered Protein Interaction Network in Embryonic Stem Cells s0: transcription factors, such as oct4, are critical for establishing and maintaining pluripotent cell identity. s1: whereas the genomic locations of several pluripotency transcription factors have been reported, the spectrum of their interaction partners is underexplored. s2: here, we use an improved affinity protocol to purify oct4-interacting proteins from mouse embryonic stem cells (escs). s3: subsequent purification of oct4 partners sall4, tcfcp2l1, dax1, and esrrb resulted in an oct4 interactome of 166 proteins, including transcription factors and chromatin-modifying complexes with documented roles in self-renewal, but also many factors not previously associated with the esc network. s4: we find that esrrb associated with the basal transcription machinery and also detect interactions between transcription factors and components of the tgf-beta, notch, and wnt signaling pathways. s5: acute depletion of oct4 reduced binding of tcfcp2l1, dax1, and esrrb to several target genes. s6: in conclusion, our purification protocol allowed us to bring greater definition to the circuitry controlling pluripotent cell identity. 	unknown 
<s> claim:Genetic deficiency of mast cells leads to decreased weight gain in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity. title: Deficiency and pharmacological stabilization of mast cells reduce diet-induced obesity and diabetes in mice s0: although mast cell functions have classically been related to allergic responses, recent studies indicate that these cells contribute to other common diseases such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, aortic aneurysm and cancer. s1: this study presents evidence that mast cells also contribute to diet-induced obesity and diabetes. s2: for example, white adipose tissue (wat) from obese humans and mice contain more mast cells than wat from their lean counterparts. s3: furthermore, in the context of mice on a western diet, genetically induced deficiency of mast cells, or their pharmacological stabilization, reduces body weight gain and levels of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and proteases in serum and wat, in concert with improved glucose homeostasis and energy expenditure. s4: mechanistic studies reveal that mast cells contribute to wat and muscle angiogenesis and associated cell apoptosis and cathepsin activity. s5: adoptive transfer experiments of cytokine-deficient mast cells show that these cells, by producing interleukin-6 (il-6) and interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma), contribute to mouse adipose tissue cysteine protease cathepsin expression, apoptosis and angiogenesis, thereby promoting diet-induced obesity and glucose intolerance. s6: our results showing reduced obesity and diabetes in mice treated with clinically available mast cell-stabilizing agents suggest the potential of developing new therapies for these common human metabolic disorders. 	true 3

<s> claim:Genomic aberrations of metastases provide information for targeted therapy. title: Evolution of metastasis revealed by mutational landscapes of chemically induced skin cancers s0: human tumors show a high level of genetic heterogeneity, but the processes that influence the timing and route of metastatic dissemination of the subclones are unknown. s1: here we have used whole-exome sequencing of 103 matched benign, malignant and metastatic skin tumors from genetically heterogeneous mice to demonstrate that most metastases disseminate synchronously from the primary tumor, supporting parallel rather than linear evolution as the predominant model of metastasis. s2: shared mutations between primary carcinomas and their matched metastases have the distinct a-to-t signature of the initiating carcinogen dimethylbenzanthracene, but non-shared mutations are primarily g-to-t, a signature associated with oxidative stress. s3: the existence of carcinomas that either did or did not metastasize in the same host animal suggests that there are tumor-intrinsic factors that influence metastatic seeding. s4: we also demonstrate the importance of germline polymorphisms in determining allele-specific mutations, and we identify somatic genetic alterations that are specifically related to initiation of carcinogenesis by hras or kras mutations. s5: mouse tumors that mimic the genetic heterogeneity of human cancers can aid our understanding of the clonal evolution of metastasis and provide a realistic model for the testing of novel therapies. 	true 5

<s> claim:Glial calcium waves influence seizures. title: An Excitatory Loop with Astrocytes Contributes to Drive Neurons to Seizure Threshold s0: seizures in focal epilepsies are sustained by a highly synchronous neuronal discharge that arises at restricted brain sites and subsequently spreads to large portions of the brain. s1: despite intense experimental research in this field, the earlier cellular events that initiate and sustain a focal seizure are still not well defined. s2: their identification is central to understand the pathophysiology of focal epilepsies and to develop new pharmacological therapies for drug-resistant forms of epilepsy. s3: the prominent involvement of astrocytes in ictogenesis was recently proposed. s4: we test here whether a cooperation between astrocytes and neurons is a prerequisite to support ictal (seizure-like) and interictal epileptiform events. s5: simultaneous patch-clamp recording and ca2+ imaging techniques were performed in a new in vitro model of focal seizures induced by local applications of n-methyl-d-aspartic acid (nmda) in rat entorhinal cortex slices. s6: we found that a ca2+ elevation in astrocytes correlates with both the initial development and the maintenance of a focal, seizure-like discharge. s7: a delayed astrocyte activation during ictal discharges was also observed in other models (including the whole in vitro isolated guinea pig brain) in which the site of generation of seizure activity cannot be precisely monitored. s8: in contrast, interictal discharges were not associated with ca2+ changes in astrocytes. s9: selective inhibition or stimulation of astrocyte ca2+ signalling blocked or enhanced, respectively, ictal discharges, but did not affect interictal discharge generation. s10: our data reveal that neurons engage astrocytes in a recurrent excitatory loop (possibly involving gliotransmission) that promotes seizure ignition and sustains the ictal discharge. s11: this neuron-astrocyte interaction may represent a novel target to develop effective therapeutic strategies to control seizures. 	true 6 10
<s> claim:Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is characterized by extensive invasion, rapid growth, necrosis, and angiogenesis. title: Guanylate binding protein 1 is a novel effector of EGFR-driven invasion in glioblastoma s0: although gbp1 (guanylate binding protein 1) was among the first interferon-inducible proteins identified, its function is still largely unknown. s1: epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) activation by amplification or mutation is one of the most frequent genetic lesions in a variety of human tumors. s2: these include glioblastoma multiforme (gbm), which is characterized by independent but interrelated features of extensive invasion into normal brain parenchyma, rapid growth, necrosis, and angiogenesis. s3: in this study, we show that egfr activation promoted gbp1 expression in gbm cell lines through a signaling pathway involving src and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. s4: moreover, we identified yy1 (yin yang 1) as the downstream transcriptional regulator regulating egfr-driven gbp1 expression. s5: gbp1 was required for egfr-mediated mmp1 (matrix metalloproteinase 1) expression and glioma cell invasion in vitro. s6: although deregulation of gbp1 expression did not affect glioma cell proliferation, overexpression of gbp1 enhanced glioma cell invasion through mmp1 induction, which required its c-terminal helical domain and was independent of its gtpase activity. s7: reducing gbp1 levels by rna interference in invasive gbm cells also markedly inhibited their ability to infiltrate the brain parenchyma of mice. s8: gbp1 expression was high and positively correlated with egfr expression in human gbm tumors and cell lines, particularly those of the neural subtype. s9: together, these findings establish gbp1 as a previously unknown link between egfr activity and mmp1 expression and nominate it as a novel potential therapeutic target for inhibiting gbm invasion. 	true 2

<s> claim:HAND2 methylation is a key step in early endometrial carcinogenesis. title: Role of DNA Methylation and Epigenetic Silencing of HAND2 in Endometrial Cancer Development s0: background endometrial cancer incidence is continuing to rise in the wake of the current ageing and obesity epidemics. s1: much of the risk for endometrial cancer development is influenced by the environment and lifestyle. s2: accumulating evidence suggests that the epigenome serves as the interface between the genome and the environment and that hypermethylation of stem cell polycomb group target genes is an epigenetic hallmark of cancer. s3: the objective of this study was to determine the functional role of epigenetic factors in endometrial cancer development.  s4: methods and findings epigenome-wide methylation analysis of >27,000 cpg sites in endometrial cancer tissue samples (n = 64) and control samples (n = 23) revealed that hand2 (a gene encoding a transcription factor expressed in the endometrial stroma) is one of the most commonly hypermethylated and silenced genes in endometrial cancer. s5: a novel integrative epigenome-transcriptome-interactome analysis further revealed that hand2 is the hub of the most highly ranked differential methylation hotspot in endometrial cancer. s6: these findings were validated using candidate gene methylation analysis in multiple clinical sample sets of tissue samples from a total of 272 additional women. s7: increased hand2 methylation was a feature of premalignant endometrial lesions and was seen to parallel a decrease in rna and protein levels. s8: furthermore, women with high endometrial hand2 methylation in their premalignant lesions were less likely to respond to progesterone treatment. s9: hand2 methylation analysis of endometrial secretions collected using high vaginal swabs taken from women with postmenopausal bleeding specifically identified those patients with early stage endometrial cancer with both high sensitivity and high specificity (receiver operating characteristics area under the curve = 0.91 for stage 1a and 0.97 for higher than stage 1a). s10: finally, mice harbouring a hand2 knock-out specifically in their endometrium were shown to develop precancerous endometrial lesions with increasing age, and these lesions also demonstrated a lack of pten expression.  s11: conclusions hand2 methylation is a common and crucial molecular alteration in endometrial cancer that could potentially be employed as a biomarker for early detection of endometrial cancer and as a predictor of treatment response. s12: the true clinical utility of hand2 dna methylation, however, requires further validation in prospective studies. s13: please see later in the article for the editors' summary. 	true 4 7 9 11
<s> claim:HIV trans-activator protein (TAT) effectively transports large and small molecules across cellular membranes into larger populations of neurons. title: Suppression of inflammatory and neuropathic pain by uncoupling CRMP-2 from the presynaptic Ca2+ channel complex s0: the use of n-type voltage-gated calcium channel (cav2.2) blockers to treat pain is limited by many physiological side effects. s1: here we report that inflammatory and neuropathic hypersensitivity can be suppressed by inhibiting the binding of collapsin response mediator protein 2 (crmp-2) to cav2.2 and thereby reducing channel function. s2: a peptide of crmp-2 fused to the hiv transactivator of transcription (tat) protein (tat-cbd3) decreased neuropeptide release from sensory neurons and excitatory synaptic transmission in dorsal horn neurons, reduced meningeal blood flow, reduced nocifensive behavior induced by formalin injection or corneal capsaicin application and reversed neuropathic hypersensitivity produced by an antiretroviral drug. s3: tat-cbd3 was mildly anxiolytic without affecting memory retrieval, sensorimotor function or depression. s4: at doses tenfold higher than that required to reduce hypersensitivity in vivo, tat-cbd3 caused a transient episode of tail kinking and body contortion. s5: by preventing crmp-2–mediated enhancement of cav2.2 function, tat-cbd3 alleviated inflammatory and neuropathic hypersensitivity, an approach that may prove useful in managing chronic pain. 	unknown

<s> claim:IL-6 signaling plays a major role in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. title: Interleukin-6 receptor pathways in coronary heart disease: a collaborative meta-analysis of 82 studies s0: background persistent inflammation has been proposed to contribute to various stages in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. s1: interleukin-6 receptor (il6r) signalling propagates downstream inflammation cascades. s2: to assess whether this pathway is causally relevant to coronary heart disease, we studied a functional genetic variant known to affect il6r signalling.  s3: methods in a collaborative meta-analysis, we studied asp358ala (rs2228145) in il6r in relation to a panel of conventional risk factors and inflammation biomarkers in 125,222 participants. s4: we also compared the frequency of asp358ala in 51,441 patients with coronary heart disease and in 136,226 controls. s5: to gain insight into possible mechanisms, we assessed asp358ala in relation to localised gene expression and to postlipopolysaccharide stimulation of interleukin 6.  s6: findings the minor allele frequency of asp358ala was 39%. s7: asp358ala was not associated with lipid concentrations, blood pressure, adiposity, dysglycaemia, or smoking (p value for association per minor allele ≥0·04 for each). s8: by contrast, for every copy of 358ala inherited, mean concentration of il6r increased by 34·3% (95% ci 30·4-38·2) and of interleukin 6 by 14·6% (10·7-18·4), and mean concentration of c-reactive protein was reduced by 7·5% (5·9-9·1) and of fibrinogen by 1·0% (0·7-1·3). s9: for every copy of 358ala inherited, risk of coronary heart disease was reduced by 3·4% (1·8-5·0). s10: asp358ala was not related to il6r mrna levels or interleukin-6 production in monocytes.  s11: interpretation large-scale human genetic and biomarker data are consistent with a causal association between il6r-related pathways and coronary heart disease.  s12: funding british heart foundation; uk medical research council; uk national institute of health research, cambridge biomedical research centre; bupa foundation. 	true 8 9 11
<s> claim:ITAM phosphorylation allows for the transfer of the T cell receptor (TCR) signal from the echo-domain to the cytoplasmic tail of the T cell receptor (TCR). title: Full activation of the T cell receptor requires both clustering and conformational changes at CD3. s0: t cell receptor (tcr-cd3) triggering involves both receptor clustering and conformational changes at the cytoplasmic tails of the cd3 subunits. s1: the mechanism by which tcralphabeta ligand binding confers conformational changes to cd3 is unknown. s2: by using well-defined ligands, we showed that induction of the conformational change requires both multivalent engagement and the mobility restriction of the tcr-cd3 imposed by the plasma membrane. s3: the conformational change is elicited by cooperative rearrangements of two tcr-cd3 complexes and does not require accompanying changes in the structure of the tcralphabeta ectodomains. s4: this conformational change at cd3 reverts upon ligand dissociation and is required for t cell activation. s5: thus, our permissive geometry model provides a molecular mechanism that rationalizes how the information of ligand binding to tcralphabeta is transmitted to the cd3 subunits and to the intracellular signaling machinery. 	unknown

<s> claim:Immune responses in immune cells are geographically segregated. title: Inflammatory signaling in human Tuberculosis granulomas is spatially organized s0: granulomas are the pathological hallmark of tuberculosis (tb). s1: however, their function and mechanisms of formation remain poorly understood. s2: to understand the role of granulomas in tb, we analyzed the proteomes of granulomas from subjects with tuberculosis in an unbiased manner. s3: using laser-capture microdissection, mass spectrometry and confocal microscopy, we generated detailed molecular maps of human granulomas. s4: we found that the centers of granulomas have a pro-inflammatory environment that is characterized by the presence of antimicrobial peptides, reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. s5: conversely, the tissue surrounding the caseum has a comparatively anti-inflammatory signature. s6: these findings are consistent across a set of six human subjects and in rabbits. s7: although the balance between systemic pro- and anti-inflammatory signals is crucial to tb disease outcome, here we find that these signals are physically segregated within each granuloma. s8: from the protein and lipid snapshots of human and rabbit lesions analyzed here, we hypothesize that the pathologic response to tb is shaped by the precise anatomical localization of these inflammatory pathways during the development of the granuloma. 	true 7

<s> claim:Increased LDL receptors plays a role in the reduction of plasma Lp(a). title: Effects of PCSK9 Inhibition With Alirocumab on Lipoprotein Metabolism in Healthy Humans s0: background alirocumab, a monoclonal antibody to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (pcsk9), lowers plasma low-density lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol and apolipoprotein b100 (apob). s1: although studies in mice and cells have identified increased hepatic ldl receptors as the basis for ldl lowering by pcsk9 inhibitors, there have been no human studies characterizing the effects of pcsk9 inhibitors on lipoprotein metabolism. s2: in particular, it is not known whether inhibition of pcsk9 has any effects on very low-density lipoprotein or intermediate-density lipoprotein (idl) metabolism. s3: inhibition of pcsk9 also results in reductions of plasma lipoprotein (a) levels. s4: the regulation of plasma lp(a) levels, including the role of ldl receptors in the clearance of lp(a), is poorly defined, and no mechanistic studies of the lp(a) lowering by alirocumab in humans have been published to date.  s5: methods eighteen (10 f, 8 mol/l) participants completed a placebo-controlled, 2-period study. s6: they received 2 doses of placebo, 2 weeks apart, followed by 5 doses of 150 mg of alirocumab, 2 weeks apart. s7: at the end of each period, fractional clearance rates (fcrs) and production rates (prs) of apob and apo(a) were determined. s8: in 10 participants, postprandial triglycerides and apob48 levels were measured.  s9: results alirocumab reduced ultracentrifugally isolated ldl-c by 55.1%, ldl-apob by 56.3%, and plasma lp(a) by 18.7%. s10: the fall in ldl-apob was caused by an 80.4% increase in ldl-apob fcr and a 23.9% reduction in ldl-apob pr. s11: the latter was due to a 46.1% increase in idl-apob fcr coupled with a 27.2% decrease in conversion of idl to ldl. s12: the fcr of apo(a) tended to increase (24.6%) without any change in apo(a) pr. s13: alirocumab had no effects on fcrs or prs of very low-density lipoproteins-apob and very low-density lipoproteins triglycerides or on postprandial plasma triglycerides or apob48 concentrations.  s14: conclusions alirocumab decreased ldl-c and ldl-apob by increasing idl- and ldl-apob fcrs and decreasing ldl-apob pr. s15: these results are consistent with increases in ldl receptors available to clear idl and ldl from blood during pcsk9 inhibition. s16: the increase in apo(a) fcr during alirocumab treatment suggests that increased ldl receptors may also play a role in the reduction of plasma lp(a).    s17: clinical trial registration url: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. s18: unique identifier: nct01959971. 	true 9 10 11 16
<s> claim:Increased conversion of PGE 2 to PPARy ligand 15-ket-PGE 2 causes accumulation of PGE. title: Pharmacological correction of a defect in PPARγ signaling ameliorates disease severity in Cftr-deficient mice s0: cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (encoded by cftr) that impair its role as an apical chloride channel that supports bicarbonate transport. s1: individuals with cystic fibrosis show retained, thickened mucus that plugs airways and obstructs luminal organs as well as numerous other abnormalities that include inflammation of affected organs, alterations in lipid metabolism and insulin resistance. s2: here we show that colonic epithelial cells and whole lung tissue from cftr-deficient mice show a defect in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (ppar-gamma, encoded by pparg) function that contributes to a pathological program of gene expression. s3: lipidomic analysis of colonic epithelial cells suggests that this defect results in part from reduced amounts of the endogenous ppar-gamma ligand 15-keto-prostaglandin e(2) (15-keto-pge(2)). s4: treatment of cftr-deficient mice with the synthetic ppar-gamma ligand rosiglitazone partially normalizes the altered gene expression pattern associated with cftr deficiency and reduces disease severity. s5: rosiglitazone has no effect on chloride secretion in the colon, but it increases expression of the genes encoding carbonic anhydrases 4 and 2 (car4 and car2), increases bicarbonate secretion and reduces mucus retention. s6: these studies reveal a reversible defect in ppar-gamma signaling in cftr-deficient cells that can be pharmacologically corrected to ameliorate the severity of the cystic fibrosis phenotype in mice. 	unknown 
<s> claim:Increased diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm. title: Blood pressure and incidence of twelve cardiovascular diseases: lifetime risks, healthy life-years lost, and age-specific associations in 1·25 million people s0: background the associations of blood pressure with the different manifestations of incident cardiovascular disease in a contemporary population have not been compared. s1: in this study, we aimed to analyse the associations of blood pressure with 12 different presentations of cardiovascular disease.  s2: methods we used linked electronic health records from 1997 to 2010 in the caliber (cardiovascular research using linked bespoke studies and electronic health records) programme to assemble a cohort of 1·25 million patients, 30 years of age or older and initially free from cardiovascular disease, a fifth of whom received blood pressure-lowering treatments. s3: we studied the heterogeneity in the age-specific associations of clinically measured blood pressure with 12 acute and chronic cardiovascular diseases, and estimated the lifetime risks (up to 95 years of age) and cardiovascular disease-free life-years lost adjusted for other risk factors at index ages 30, 60, and 80 years. s4: this study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov, number nct01164371.  s5: findings during 5·2 years median follow-up, we recorded 83,098 initial cardiovascular disease presentations. s6: in each age group, the lowest risk for cardiovascular disease was in people with systolic blood pressure of 90-114 mm hg and diastolic blood pressure of 60-74 mm hg, with no evidence of a j-shaped increased risk at lower blood pressures. s7: the effect of high blood pressure varied by cardiovascular disease endpoint, from strongly positive to no effect. s8: associations with high systolic blood pressure were strongest for intracerebral haemorrhage (hazard ratio 1·44 [95% ci 1·32-1·58]), subarachnoid haemorrhage (1·43 [1·25-1·63]), and stable angina (1·41 [1·36-1·46]), and weakest for abdominal aortic aneurysm (1·08 [1·00-1·17]). s9: compared with diastolic blood pressure, raised systolic blood pressure had a greater effect on angina, myocardial infarction, and peripheral arterial disease, whereas raised diastolic blood pressure had a greater effect on abdominal aortic aneurysm than did raised systolic pressure. s10: pulse pressure associations were inverse for abdominal aortic aneurysm (hr per 10 mm hg 0·91 [95% ci 0·86-0·98]) and strongest for peripheral arterial disease (1·23 [1·20-1·27]). s11: people with hypertension (blood pressure ≥140/90 mm hg or those receiving blood pressure-lowering drugs) had a lifetime risk of overall cardiovascular disease at 30 years of age of 63·3% (95% ci 62·9-63·8) compared with 46·1% (45·5-46·8) for those with normal blood pressure, and developed cardiovascular disease 5·0 years earlier (95% ci 4·8-5·2). s12: stable and unstable angina accounted for most (43%) of the cardiovascular disease-free years of life lost associated with hypertension from index age 30 years, whereas heart failure and stable angina accounted for the largest proportion (19% each) of years of life lost from index age 80 years.  s13: interpretation the widely held assumptions that blood pressure has strong associations with the occurrence of all cardiovascular diseases across a wide age range, and that diastolic and systolic associations are concordant, are not supported by the findings of this high-resolution study. s14: despite modern treatments, the lifetime burden of hypertension is substantial. s15: these findings emphasise the need for new blood pressure-lowering strategies, and will help to inform the design of randomised trials to assess them.  s16: funding medical research council, national institute for health research, and wellcome trust. 	true 9

<s> claim:Increased lipolysis leads to higher P38 phosphorylation in adipose tissue. title: Activation of AMPKα2 in adipocytes is essential for nicotine-induced insulin resistance in vivo s0: cigarette smoking promotes body weight reduction in humans while paradoxically also promoting insulin resistance (ir) and hyperinsulinemia. s1: however, the mechanisms behind these effects are unclear. s2: here we show that nicotine, a major constituent of cigarette smoke, selectively activates amp-activated protein kinase α2 (ampkα2) in adipocytes, which in turn phosphorylates map kinase phosphatase-1 (mkp1) at serine 334, initiating its proteasome-dependent degradation. s3: the nicotine-dependent reduction of mkp1 induces the aberrant activation of both p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-jun n-terminal kinase, leading to increased phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (irs1) at serine 307. s4: phosphorylation of irs1 leads to its degradation, protein kinase b inhibition, and the loss of insulin-mediated inhibition of lipolysis. s5: consequently, nicotine increases lipolysis, which results in body weight reduction, but this increase also elevates the levels of circulating free fatty acids and thus causes ir in insulin-sensitive tissues. s6: these results establish ampkα2 as an essential mediator of nicotine-induced whole-body ir in spite of reductions in adiposity. 	unknown

<s> claim:Induction of urokinase receptor signaling in podocytes causes foot process effacement and proteinuria. title: Modification of kidney barrier function by the urokinase receptor s0: podocyte dysfunction, represented by foot process effacement and proteinuria, is often the starting point for progressive kidney disease. s1: therapies aimed at the cellular level of the disease are currently not available. s2: here we show that induction of urokinase receptor (upar) signaling in podocytes leads to foot process effacement and urinary protein loss via a mechanism that includes lipid-dependent activation of αvβ3 integrin. s3: mice lacking upar (plaur−/−) are protected from lipopolysaccharide (lps)-mediated proteinuria but develop disease after expression of a constitutively active β3 integrin. s4: gene transfer studies reveal a prerequisite for upar expression in podocytes, but not in endothelial cells, for the development of lps-mediated proteinuria. s5: mechanistically, upar is required to activate αvβ3 integrin in podocytes, promoting cell motility and activation of the small gtpases cdc42 and rac1. s6: blockade of αvβ3 integrin reduces podocyte motility in vitro and lowers proteinuria in mice. s7: our findings show a physiological role for upar signaling in the regulation of kidney permeability. 	true 2
<s> claim:Inhibiting HDAC6 increases survival of mice with ARID1A mutated tumors. title: ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancers depend on HDAC6 activity s0: arid1a, encoding a subunit of the swi/snf chromatin-remodelling complex, is the most frequently mutated epigenetic regulator across all human cancers. s1: arid1a and tp53 mutations are typically mutually exclusive. s2: therapeutic approaches that correlate with this genetic characteristic remain to be explored. s3: here, we show that hdac6 activity is essential in arid1a-mutated ovarian cancers. s4: inhibition of hdac6 activity using a clinically applicable small-molecule inhibitor significantly improved the survival of mice bearing arid1a-mutated tumours. s5: this correlated with the suppression of growth and dissemination of arid1a-mutated, but not wild-type, tumours. s6: the dependence on hdac6 activity in arid1a-mutated cells correlated with a direct transcriptional repression of hdac6 by arid1a. s7: hdac6 inhibition selectively promoted apoptosis of arid1a-mutated cells. s8: hdac6 directly deacetylates lys120 of p53, a pro-apoptotic post-translational modification. s9: thus, arid1a mutation inactivates the apoptosis-promoting function of p53 by upregulating hdac6. s10: together, these results indicate that pharmacological inhibition of hdac6 is a therapeutic strategy for arid1a-mutated cancers. 	true 4

<s> claim:Inhibiting glucose-6-phospate dehydrogenase improves lipogenesis by deactivating LKB1-AMPK signaling. title: 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase links oxidative PPP, lipogenesis and tumor growth by inhibiting LKB1-AMPK signaling s0: the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (ppp) contributes to tumour growth, but the precise contribution of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6pgd), the third enzyme in this pathway, to tumorigenesis remains unclear. s1: we found that suppression of 6pgd decreased lipogenesis and rna biosynthesis and elevated ros levels in cancer cells, attenuating cell proliferation and tumour growth. s2: 6pgd-mediated production of ribulose-5-phosphate (ru-5-p) inhibits ampk activation by disrupting the active lkb1 complex, thereby activating acetyl-coa carboxylase 1 and lipogenesis. s3: ru-5-p and nadph are thought to be precursors in rna biosynthesis and lipogenesis, respectively; thus, our findings provide an additional link between the oxidative ppp and lipogenesis through ru-5-p-dependent inhibition of lkb1-ampk signalling. s4: moreover, we identified and developed 6pgd inhibitors, physcion and its derivative s3, that effectively inhibited 6pgd, cancer cell proliferation and tumour growth in nude mice xenografts without obvious toxicity, suggesting that 6pgd could be an anticancer target. 	false 1 2

<s> claim:KLF4 is necessary for VSMCs to gain genetic characteristics of other cell types within atherosclerotic lesions. title: KLF4-dependent phenotypic modulation of smooth muscle cells has a key role in atherosclerotic plaque pathogenesis s0: previous studies investigating the role of smooth muscle cells (smcs) and macrophages in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis have provided controversial results owing to the use of unreliable methods for clearly identifying each of these cell types. s1: here, using myh11-creert2 rosa floxed stop eyfp apoe−/− mice to perform smc lineage tracing, we find that traditional methods for detecting smcs based on immunostaining for smc markers fail to detect >80% of smc-derived cells within advanced atherosclerotic lesions. s2: these unidentified smc-derived cells exhibit phenotypes of other cell lineages, including macrophages and mesenchymal stem cells (mscs). s3: smc-specific conditional knockout of krüppel-like factor 4 (klf4) resulted in reduced numbers of smc-derived msc- and macrophage-like cells, a marked reduction in lesion size, and increases in multiple indices of plaque stability, including an increase in fibrous cap thickness as compared to wild-type controls. s4: on the basis of in vivo klf4 chromatin immunoprecipitation–sequencing (chip-seq) analyses and studies of cholesterol-treated cultured smcs, we identified >800 klf4 target genes, including many that regulate pro-inflammatory responses of smcs. s5: our findings indicate that the contribution of smcs to atherosclerotic plaques has been greatly underestimated, and that klf4-dependent transitions in smc phenotype are critical in lesion pathogenesis. 	true 5

<s> claim:Kir7.1 modulates channel activity by the G protein-coupled melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. title: G-protein-independent coupling of MC4R to Kir7.1 in hypothalamic neurons s0: the regulated release of anorexigenic α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-msh) and orexigenic agouti-related protein (agrp) from discrete hypothalamic arcuate neurons onto common target sites in the central nervous system has a fundamental role in the regulation of energy homeostasis. s1: both peptides bind with high affinity to the melanocortin-4 receptor (mc4r); existing data show that α-msh is an agonist that couples the receptor to the gαs signalling pathway, while agrp binds competitively to block α-msh binding and blocks the constitutive activity mediated by the ligand-mimetic amino-terminal domain of the receptor. s2: here we show that, in mice, regulation of firing activity of neurons from the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (pvn) by α-msh and agrp can be mediated independently of gαs signalling by ligand-induced coupling of mc4r to closure of inwardly rectifying potassium channel, kir7.1. s3: furthermore, agrp is a biased agonist that hyperpolarizes neurons by binding to mc4r and opening kir7.1, independently of its inhibition of α-msh binding. s4: consequently, kir7.1 signalling appears to be central to melanocortin-mediated regulation of energy homeostasis within the pvn. s5: coupling of mc4r to kir7.1 may explain unusual aspects of the control of energy homeostasis by melanocortin signalling, including the gene dosage effect of mc4r and the sustained effects of agrp on food intake. 	true 2

<s> claim:Less than 10% of patients exposed to radiation have activated markers of mesenchymal stem cells. title: KLF4-dependent phenotypic modulation of smooth muscle cells has a key role in atherosclerotic plaque pathogenesis s0: previous studies investigating the role of smooth muscle cells (smcs) and macrophages in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis have provided controversial results owing to the use of unreliable methods for clearly identifying each of these cell types. s1: here, using myh11-creert2 rosa floxed stop eyfp apoe−/− mice to perform smc lineage tracing, we find that traditional methods for detecting smcs based on immunostaining for smc markers fail to detect >80% of smc-derived cells within advanced atherosclerotic lesions. s2: these unidentified smc-derived cells exhibit phenotypes of other cell lineages, including macrophages and mesenchymal stem cells (mscs). s3: smc-specific conditional knockout of krüppel-like factor 4 (klf4) resulted in reduced numbers of smc-derived msc- and macrophage-like cells, a marked reduction in lesion size, and increases in multiple indices of plaque stability, including an increase in fibrous cap thickness as compared to wild-type controls. s4: on the basis of in vivo klf4 chromatin immunoprecipitation–sequencing (chip-seq) analyses and studies of cholesterol-treated cultured smcs, we identified >800 klf4 target genes, including many that regulate pro-inflammatory responses of smcs. s5: our findings indicate that the contribution of smcs to atherosclerotic plaques has been greatly underestimated, and that klf4-dependent transitions in smc phenotype are critical in lesion pathogenesis. 	unknown 
<s> claim:Lice attenuated SIV vaccines induce a stronger antigen-specific T cell response in lymph node cells. title: Lymph node T cell responses predict the efficacy of live attenuated SIV vaccines s0: live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus (siv) vaccines (lavs) remain the most efficacious of all vaccines in nonhuman primate models of hiv and aids, yet the basis of their robust protection remains poorly understood. s1: here we show that the degree of lav-mediated protection against intravenous wild-type sivmac239 challenge strongly correlates with the magnitude and function of siv-specific, effector-differentiated t cells in the lymph node but not with the responses of such t cells in the blood or with other cellular, humoral and innate immune parameters. s2: we found that maintenance of protective t cell responses is associated with persistent lav replication in the lymph node, which occurs almost exclusively in follicular helper t cells. s3: thus, effective lavs maintain lymphoid tissue-based, effector-differentiated, siv-specific t cells that intercept and suppress early wild-type siv amplification and, if present in sufficient frequencies, can completely control and perhaps clear infection, an observation that provides a rationale for the development of safe, persistent vectors that can elicit and maintain such responses. 	true 1
<s> claim:Lipopolysaccharides have an inflammation independent effect on kidney barrier function. title: Modification of kidney barrier function by the urokinase receptor s0: podocyte dysfunction, represented by foot process effacement and proteinuria, is often the starting point for progressive kidney disease. s1: therapies aimed at the cellular level of the disease are currently not available. s2: here we show that induction of urokinase receptor (upar) signaling in podocytes leads to foot process effacement and urinary protein loss via a mechanism that includes lipid-dependent activation of αvβ3 integrin. s3: mice lacking upar (plaur−/−) are protected from lipopolysaccharide (lps)-mediated proteinuria but develop disease after expression of a constitutively active β3 integrin. s4: gene transfer studies reveal a prerequisite for upar expression in podocytes, but not in endothelial cells, for the development of lps-mediated proteinuria. s5: mechanistically, upar is required to activate αvβ3 integrin in podocytes, promoting cell motility and activation of the small gtpases cdc42 and rac1. s6: blockade of αvβ3 integrin reduces podocyte motility in vitro and lowers proteinuria in mice. s7: our findings show a physiological role for upar signaling in the regulation of kidney permeability. 	unknown

<s> claim:Localization of PIN1 in the roots of Arabidopsis requires VPS9a title: Generation of cell polarity in plants links endocytosis, auxin distribution and cell fate decisions s0: dynamically polarized membrane proteins define different cell boundaries and have an important role in intercellular communication—a vital feature of multicellular development. s1: efflux carriers for the signalling molecule auxin from the pin family are landmarks of cell polarity in plants and have a crucial involvement in auxin distribution-dependent development including embryo patterning, organogenesis and tropisms. s2: polar pin localization determines the direction of intercellular auxin flow, yet the mechanisms generating pin polarity remain unclear. s3: here we identify an endocytosis-dependent mechanism of pin polarity generation and analyse its developmental implications. s4: real-time pin tracking showed that after synthesis, pins are initially delivered to the plasma membrane in a non-polar manner and their polarity is established by subsequent endocytic recycling. s5: interference with pin endocytosis either by auxin or by manipulation of the arabidopsis rab5 gtpase pathway prevents pin polarization. s6: failure of pin polarization transiently alters asymmetric auxin distribution during embryogenesis and increases the local auxin response in apical embryo regions. s7: this results in ectopic expression of auxin pathway-associated root-forming master regulators in embryonic leaves and promotes homeotic transformation of leaves to roots. s8: our results indicate a two-step mechanism for the generation of pin polar localization and the essential role of endocytosis in this process. s9: it also highlights the link between endocytosis-dependent polarity of individual cells and auxin distribution-dependent cell fate establishment for multicellular patterning. 	unknown 
<s> claim:Long - range chromatin interactions regulate transcription. title: Enhancer Evolution across 20 Mammalian Species s0: the mammalian radiation has corresponded with rapid changes in noncoding regions of the genome, but we lack a comprehensive understanding of regulatory evolution in mammals. s1: here, we track the evolution of promoters and enhancers active in liver across 20 mammalian species from six diverse orders by profiling genomic enrichment of h3k27 acetylation and h3k4 trimethylation. s2: we report that rapid evolution of enhancers is a universal feature of mammalian genomes. s3: most of the recently evolved enhancers arise from ancestral dna exaptation, rather than lineage-specific expansions of repeat elements. s4: in contrast, almost all liver promoters are partially or fully conserved across these species. s5: our data further reveal that recently evolved enhancers can be associated with genes under positive selection, demonstrating the power of this approach for annotating regulatory adaptations in genomic sequences. s6: these results provide important insight into the functional genetics underpinning mammalian regulatory evolution. 	unknown

<s> claim:Low nucleosome occupancy correlates with high methylation levels across species. title: Dnmt1-Independent CG Methylation Contributes to Nucleosome Positioning in Diverse Eukaryotes s0: dnmt1 epigenetically propagates symmetrical cg methylation in many eukaryotes. s1: their genomes are typically depleted of cg dinucleotides because of imperfect repair of deaminated methylcytosines. s2: here, we extensively survey diverse species lacking dnmt1 and show that, surprisingly, symmetrical cg methylation is nonetheless frequently present and catalyzed by a different dna methyltransferase family, dnmt5. s3: numerous dnmt5-containing organisms that diverged more than a billion years ago exhibit clustered methylation, specifically in nucleosome linkers. s4: clustered methylation occurs at unprecedented densities and directly disfavors nucleosomes, contributing to nucleosome positioning between clusters. s5: dense methylation is enabled by a regime of genomic sequence evolution that enriches cg dinucleotides and drives the highest cg frequencies known. s6: species with linker methylation have small, transcriptionally active nuclei that approach the physical limits of chromatin compaction. s7: these features constitute a previously unappreciated genome architecture, in which dense methylation influences nucleosome positions, likely facilitating nuclear processes under extreme spatial constraints. 	true 4
<s> claim:Ly49Q directs the organization of neutrophil polarization by regulating membrane raft functions. title: The Ly49Q receptor plays a crucial role in neutrophil polarization and migration by regulating raft trafficking. s0: neutrophils rapidly undergo polarization and directional movement to infiltrate the sites of infection and inflammation. s1: here, we show that an inhibitory mhc i receptor, ly49q, was crucial for the swift polarization of and tissue infiltration by neutrophils. s2: during the steady state, ly49q inhibited neutrophil adhesion by preventing focal-complex formation, likely by inhibiting src and pi3 kinases. s3: however, in the presence of inflammatory stimuli, ly49q mediated rapid neutrophil polarization and tissue infiltration in an itim-domain-dependent manner. s4: these opposite functions appeared to be mediated by distinct use of effector phosphatase shp-1 and shp-2. s5: ly49q-dependent polarization and migration were affected by ly49q regulation of membrane raft functions. s6: we propose that ly49q is pivotal in switching neutrophils to their polarized morphology and rapid migration upon inflammation, through its spatiotemporal regulation of membrane rafts and raft-associated signaling molecules. 	true 5 6

<s> claim:Many cytokines that are produced by cancer cells also contribute to carcinogenesis. title: Autocrine VEGF Signaling Synergizes with EGFR in Tumor Cells to Promote Epithelial Cancer Development s0: it is established that tumor cell-derived vegf acts on endothelial cells to promote angiogenesis and tumor growth. s1: here, we demonstrate that in k5-sos-dependent mouse skin tumors, autocrine vegf is required for tumor cell proliferation in a cell-autonomous and angiogenesis-independent manner. s2: vegf is upregulated in sos-expressing tumors, and its deletion in epidermal cells delays tumorigenesis by suppressing angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation. s3: epidermis-specific flt1 deletion also impairs tumorigenesis and proliferation. s4: surprisingly, complete tumor inhibition occurs in the absence of vegf in egfr mutant mice, demonstrating that vegfr and egfr synergize in neoplastic cells to promote tumor growth. s5: mechanistically, k5-sos upregulates vegf, flt1, and neuropilin-1 in an erk-dependent manner, thereby activating an autocrine proliferation loop, whereas egfr prevents tumor cells from apoptosis. s6: moreover, flt1 is upregulated in human scc, and its inhibition in scc cells impairs proliferation. s7: thus, in addition to regulating angiogenesis, vegf has to be considered as a potent growth factor for epidermal tumors. 	unknown 
<s> claim:Many transmembrane receptors transmit signals by long-range conformational changes in the association of alpha-helices across the plasma membrane. title: Dynamic Helix Interactions in Transmembrane Signaling s0: studying how protein transmembrane domains transmit signals across membranes is beset by unique challenges. s1: here, we discuss the circumstances that have led to success and reflect on what has been learned from these examples. s2: such efforts suggest that some of the most interesting properties of transmembrane helix interactions may be the least amenable to study by current techniques. 	unknown 
<s> claim:Marmosets have a brain region homologous to Broca's area. title: Responses of primate frontal cortex neurons during natural vocal communication. s0: the role of primate frontal cortex in vocal communication and its significance in language evolution have a controversial history. s1: while evidence indicates that vocalization processing occurs in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex neurons, vocal-motor activity has been conjectured to be primarily subcortical and suggestive of a distinctly different neural architecture from humans. s2: direct evidence of neural activity during natural vocal communication is limited, as previous studies were performed in chair-restrained animals. s3: here we recorded the activity of single neurons across multiple regions of prefrontal and premotor cortex while freely moving marmosets engaged in a natural vocal behavior known as antiphonal calling. s4: our aim was to test whether neurons in marmoset frontal cortex exhibited responses during vocal-signal processing and/or vocal-motor production in the context of active, natural communication. s5: we observed motor-related changes in single neuron activity during vocal production, but relatively weak sensory responses for vocalization processing during this natural behavior. s6: vocal-motor responses occurred both prior to and during call production and were typically coupled to the timing of each vocalization pulse. s7: despite the relatively weak sensory responses a population classifier was able to distinguish between neural activity that occurred during presentations of vocalization stimuli that elicited an antiphonal response and those that did not. s8: these findings are suggestive of the role that nonhuman primate frontal cortex neurons play in natural communication and provide an important foundation for more explicit tests of the functional contributions of these neocortical areas during vocal behaviors. 	unknown 
<s> claim:Mathematical models predict that using Artemisinin-based combination therapy over nongametocytocidal drugs have only a modest impact in reducing malaria transmission. title: Modelling the Impact of Artemisinin Combination Therapy and Long-Acting Treatments on Malaria Transmission Intensity s0: background artemisinin derivatives used in recently introduced combination therapies (acts) for plasmodium falciparum malaria significantly lower patient infectiousness and have the potential to reduce population-level transmission of the parasite. s1: with the increased interest in malaria elimination, understanding the impact on transmission of act and other antimalarial drugs with different pharmacodynamics becomes a key issue. s2: this study estimates the reduction in transmission that may be achieved by introducing different types of treatment for symptomatic p. falciparum malaria in endemic areas.  s3: methods and findings we developed a mathematical model to predict the potential impact on transmission outcomes of introducing act as first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in six areas of varying transmission intensity in tanzania. s4: we also estimated the impact that could be achieved by antimalarials with different efficacy, prophylactic time, and gametocytocidal effects. s5: rates of treatment, asymptomatic infection, and symptomatic infection in the six study areas were estimated using the model together with data from a cross-sectional survey of 5,667 individuals conducted prior to policy change from sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine to act. s6: the effects of act and other drug types on gametocytaemia and infectiousness to mosquitoes were independently estimated from clinical trial data. s7: predicted percentage reductions in prevalence of infection and incidence of clinical episodes achieved by act were highest in the areas with low initial transmission. s8: a 53% reduction in prevalence of infection was seen if 100% of current treatment was switched to act in the area where baseline slide-prevalence of parasitaemia was lowest (3.7%), compared to an 11% reduction in the highest-transmission setting (baseline slide prevalence = 57.1%). s9: estimated percentage reductions in incidence of clinical episodes were similar. s10: the absolute size of the public health impact, however, was greater in the highest-transmission area, with 54 clinical episodes per 100 persons per year averted compared to five per 100 persons per year in the lowest-transmission area. s11: high coverage was important. s12: reducing presumptive treatment through improved diagnosis substantially reduced the number of treatment courses required per clinical episode averted in the lower-transmission settings although there was some loss of overall impact on transmission. s13: an efficacious antimalarial regimen with no specific gametocytocidal properties but a long prophylactic time was estimated to be more effective at reducing transmission than a short-acting act in the highest-transmission setting.  s14: conclusions our results suggest that acts have the potential for transmission reductions approaching those achieved by insecticide-treated nets in lower-transmission settings. s15: act partner drugs and nonartemisinin regimens with longer prophylactic times could result in a larger impact in higher-transmission settings, although their long term benefit must be evaluated in relation to the risk of development of parasite resistance. 	true 13
<s> claim:MeCP2 influences the synaptic maturation of neurons. title: Structural Homeostasis: Compensatory Adjustments of Dendritic Arbor Geometry in Response to Variations of Synaptic Input  s0: as the nervous system develops, there is an inherent variability in the connections formed between differentiating neurons. s1: despite this variability, neural circuits form that are functional and remarkably robust. s2: one way in which neurons deal with variability in their inputs is through compensatory, homeostatic changes in their electrical properties. s3: here, we show that neurons also make compensatory adjustments to their structure. s4: we analysed the development of dendrites on an identified central neuron (acc) in the late drosophila embryo at the stage when it receives its first connections and first becomes electrically active. s5: at the same time, we charted the distribution of presynaptic sites on the developing postsynaptic arbor. s6: genetic manipulations of the presynaptic partners demonstrate that the postsynaptic dendritic arbor adjusts its growth to compensate for changes in the activity and density of synaptic sites. s7: blocking the synthesis or evoked release of presynaptic neurotransmitter results in greater dendritic extension. s8: conversely, an increase in the density of presynaptic release sites induces a reduction in the extent of the dendritic arbor. s9: these growth adjustments occur locally in the arbor and are the result of the promotion or inhibition of growth of neurites in the proximity of presynaptic sites. s10: we provide evidence that suggest a role for the postsynaptic activity state of protein kinase a in mediating this structural adjustment, which modifies dendritic growth in response to synaptic activity. s11: these findings suggest that the dendritic arbor, at least during early stages of connectivity, behaves as a homeostatic device that adjusts its size and geometry to the level and the distribution of input received. s12: the growing arbor thus counterbalances naturally occurring variations in synaptic density and activity so as to ensure that an appropriate level of input is achieved. 	unknown 
<s> claim:Measuring routine outcomes is more beneficial to clinical practice than assessing treatment adherence. title: Anxiety s0: objectives to examine the effect of routinely administered psychiatric questionnaires on the recognition, management, and outcome of psychiatric disorders in non-psychiatric settings.  s1: data sources embase, medline, psyclit, cinahl, cochrane controlled trials register, and hand searches of key journals.  s2: methods a systematic review of randomised controlled trials of the administration and routine feedback of psychiatric screening and outcome questionnaires to clinicians in non-psychiatric settings. s3: narrative overview of key design features and end points, together with a random effects quantitative synthesis of comparable studies.  s4: main outcome measures recognition of psychiatric disorders after feedback of questionnaire results; interventions for psychiatric disorders; and outcome of psychiatric disorders.  s5: results nine randomised studies were identified that examined the use of common psychiatric instruments in primary care and general hospital settings. s6: studies compared the effect of the administration of these instruments followed by the feedback of the results to clinicians, with administration with no feedback. s7: meta-analytic pooling was possible for four of these studies (2457 participants), which measured the effect of feedback on the recognition of depressive disorders. s8: routine administration and feedback of scores for all patients (irrespective of score) did not increase the overall rate of recognition of mental disorders such as anxiety and depression (relative risk of detection of depression by clinician after feedback 0.95, 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 1.09). s9: two studies showed that routine administration followed by selective feedback for only high scorers increased the rate of recognition of depression (relative risk of detection of depression after feedback 2.64, 1.62 to 4.31). s10: this increased recognition, however, did not translate into an increased rate of intervention. s11: overall, studies of routine administration of psychiatric measures did not show an effect on patient outcome.  s12: conclusions the routine measurement of outcome is a costly exercise. s13: little evidence shows that it is of benefit in improving psychosocial outcomes of those with psychiatric disorder managed in non-psychiatric settings. 	unknown

<s> claim:Osteocytes have an essential role in G-CSF induced HSPC mobilization. title: Matrix-embedded osteocytes regulate mobilization of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. s0: the bone marrow (bm) niche comprises multiple cell types that regulate hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (hspc) migration out of the niche and into the circulation. s1: here, we demonstrate that osteocytes, the major cellular component of mature bone, are regulators of hspc egress. s2: granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (g-csf), used clinically to mobilize hspcs, induces changes in the morphology and gene expression of the osteocytic network that precedes changes in osteoblasts. s3: this rapid response is likely under control of the sympathetic nervous system, since osteocytes express the β2-adrenergic receptor and surgical sympathectomy prevents it. s4: mice with targeted ablation of osteocytes or a disrupted osteocyte network have comparable numbers of hspcs in the bm but fail to mobilize hspcs in response to g-csf. s5: taken together, these results indicate that the bm/bone niche interface is critically controlled from inside of the bone matrix and establish an important physiological role for skeletal tissues in hematopoietic function. 	true 2 4

<s> claim:PRC1-bound plasmids sediment at a slower rate in unbound plasmids than in sucrose gradients. title: Polycomb Proteins Remain Bound to Chromatin and DNA during DNA Replication In Vitro s0: the transcriptional status of a gene can be maintained through multiple rounds of cell division during development. s1: this epigenetic effect is believed to reflect heritable changes in chromatin folding and histone modifications or variants at target genes, but little is known about how these chromatin features are inherited through cell division. s2: a particular challenge for maintaining transcription states is dna replication, which disrupts or dilutes chromatin-associated proteins and histone modifications. s3: prc1-class polycomb group protein complexes are essential for development and are thought to heritably silence transcription by altering chromatin folding and histone modifications. s4: it is not known whether these complexes and their effects are maintained during dna replication or subsequently re-established. s5: we find that when prc1-class polycomb complex-bound chromatin or dna is replicated in vitro, polycomb complexes remain bound to replicated templates. s6: retention of polycomb proteins through dna replication may contribute to maintenance of transcriptional silencing through cell division. 	unknown 
<s> claim:PTEN is a regulator for the transcriptional activity of SRF title: Nuclear PTEN functions as an essential regulator of SRF-dependent transcription to control smooth muscle differentiation s0: vascular disease progression is associated with marked changes in vascular smooth muscle cell (smc) phenotype and function. s1: smc contractile gene expression and, thus differentiation, is under direct transcriptional control by the transcription factor, serum response factor (srf); however, the mechanisms dynamically regulating smc phenotype are not fully defined. s2: here we report that the lipid and protein phosphatase, pten, has a novel role in the nucleus by functioning as an indispensible regulator with srf to maintain the differentiated sm phenotype. s3: pten interacts with the n-terminal domain of srf and pten-srf interaction promotes srf binding to essential promoter elements in sm-specific genes. s4: factors inducing phenotypic switching promote loss of nuclear pten through nucleo-cytoplasmic translocation resulting in reduced myogenically active srf, but enhanced srf activity on target genes involved in proliferation. s5: overall decreased expression of pten was observed in intimal smcs of human atherosclerotic lesions underlying the potential clinical importance of these findings. 	true 2 3 4

<s> claim:Perigenital skin is not the primary site of HIV acquisition. title: Persistence of HIV-1 Receptor-Positive Cells after HSV-2 Reactivation: A Potential Mechanism for Increased HIV-1 Acquisition s0: to explore the mechanism by which herpes simplex virus (hsv)-2 infection is related to hiv-1 acquisition, we conducted in situ analysis of the cellular infiltrate from sequential biopsies of hsv-2 lesions from patients on and off antiviral therapy. s1: cd4(+) and cd8(+) t cells and a mixed population of plasmacytoid and myeloid dendritic cells (dcs), including cells expressing the c-type lectin receptor dc-sign, persisted at sites of hsv-2 reactivation for months after healing, even with daily antiviral therapy. s2: the cd4(+) t cells that persisted reacted to hsv-2 antigen, were enriched for expression of the chemokine receptor ccr5, and were contiguous to dcs expressing the interleukin-3 receptor cd123 or dc-sign. s3: ex vivo infection with a ccr5-tropic strain of hiv-1 revealed greater concentrations of integrated hiv-1 dna in cells derived from healed genital lesion biopsies than in cells from control skin biopsies. s4: the persistence and enrichment of hiv receptor-positive inflammatory cells in the genitalia help explain the inability of anti-hsv-2 therapy to reduce hiv acquisition. 	unknown 
<s> claim:Peroxynitrite is required for induction of T cell tolerance. title: Altered recognition of antigen is a mechanism of CD8+ T cell tolerance in cancer s0: antigen-specific cd8+ t-cell tolerance, induced by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (mdscs), is one of the main mechanisms of tumor escape. s1: using in vivo models, we show here that mdscs directly disrupt the binding of specific peptide–major histocompatibility complex (pmhc) dimers to cd8-expressing t cells through nitration of tyrosines in a t-cell receptor (tcr)-cd8 complex. s2: this process makes cd8-expressing t cells unable to bind pmhc and to respond to the specific peptide, although they retain their ability to respond to nonspecific stimulation. s3: nitration of tcr-cd8 is induced by mdscs through hyperproduction of reactive oxygen species and peroxynitrite during direct cell-cell contact. s4: molecular modeling suggests specific sites of nitration that might affect the conformational flexibility of tcr-cd8 and its interaction with pmhc. s5: these data identify a previously unknown mechanism of t-cell tolerance in cancer that is also pertinent to many pathological conditions associated with accumulation of mdscs. 	true 3 5

<s> claim:Physical injury represses transgultaminase activity. title: Transglutaminase 2 Undergoes a Large Conformational Change upon Activation  s0: human transglutaminase 2 (tg2), a member of a large family of enzymes that catalyze protein crosslinking, plays an important role in the extracellular matrix biology of many tissues and is implicated in the gluten-induced pathogenesis of celiac sprue. s1: although vertebrate transglutaminases have been studied extensively, thus far all structurally characterized members of this family have been crystallized in conformations with inaccessible active sites. s2: we have trapped human tg2 in complex with an inhibitor that mimics inflammatory gluten peptide substrates and have solved, at 2-a resolution, its x-ray crystal structure. s3: the inhibitor stabilizes tg2 in an extended conformation that is dramatically different from earlier transglutaminase structures. s4: the active site is exposed, revealing that catalysis takes place in a tunnel, bridged by two tryptophan residues that separate acyl-donor from acyl-acceptor and stabilize the tetrahedral reaction intermediates. s5: site-directed mutagenesis was used to investigate the acyl-acceptor side of the tunnel, yielding mutants with a marked increase in preference for hydrolysis over transamidation. s6: by providing the ability to visualize this activated conformer, our results create a foundation for understanding the catalytic as well as the non-catalytic roles of tg2 in biology, and for dissecting the process by which the autoantibody response to tg2 is induced in celiac sprue patients. 	unknown

<s> claim:Primary cervical cytology screening with HPV detection has higher longitudinal sensitivity to detect severe cervical intraepithelial neoplasia than conventional cytology. title: Evidence regarding human papillomavirus testing in secondary prevention of cervical cancer. s0: more than ever, clinicians need regularly updated reviews given the continuously increasing amount of new information regarding innovative cervical cancer prevention methods. s1: a summary is given from recent meta-analyses and systematic reviews on 3 possible clinical applications of human papillomavirus (hpv) testing: triage of women with equivocal or low-grade cytologic abnormalities; prediction of the therapeutic outcome after treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin) lesions, and last not but not least, primary screening for cervical cancer and pre-cancer. s2: consistent evidence is available indicating that hpv-triage with the hybrid capture(®) 2 assay (qiagen gaithersburg, inc., md, usa [previously digene corp.] (hc2) is more accurate (higher sensitivity, similar specificity) than repeat cytology to triage women with equivocal pap smear results. s3: several other tests show at least similar accuracy but mrna testing with the aptima(®) (gen-probe inc., san diego, ca, usa) test is similarly sensitive but more specific compared to hc2. s4: in triage of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (lsil), hc2 is more sensitive but its specificity is substantially lower compared to repeat cytology. s5: the aptima(®) test is more specific than hc2 without showing a loss in sensitivity. s6: identification of dna of hpv types 16 and/or 18, or rna from the five most carcinogenic hpv types allow selecting women at highest risk for cin3+ but the sensitivity and negative predictive value of these markers are lower than full-range high-risk hpv (hrhpv) testing. s7: after conservative treatment of cervical pre-cancer, hpv testing picks up more quickly, with higher sensitivity and not lower specificity, residual or recurrent high-grade cin than follow-up cytology. s8: primary screening for hrhpv generally detects more cin2, cin3 or cancer compared to cytology at cut-off atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (asc-us) or lsil, but is less specific. s9: combined hpv and cytology screening provides a further small gain in sensitivity at the expense of a considerable loss in specificity if positive by either test is referred to colposcopy, in comparison with hpv testing only. s10: randomised trials and follow-up of cohort studies consistently demonstrate a significantly lower cumulative incidence of cin3+ and even of cancer, in women aged 30 years or older, who were at enrollment hrhpv dna negative compared to those who were cytologically negative. s11: the difference in cumulative risk of cin3+ or cancer for double negative (cytology & hpv) versus only hpv-negative women is small. s12: hc2, gp5+/6+ pcr (polymerase chain reaction), cobas(®) 4800 pcr (roche molecular systems inc., alameda, ca, usa) and real time pcr (abbott molecular, des plaines, il, usa) can be considered as clinically validated for use in primary screening. s13: the loss in specificity associated with primary hpv-based screening can be compensated by appropriate algorithms involving reflex cytology and/or hpv genotyping for hpv16 or 18. s14: there exists a substantial evidence base to support that hpv testing is advantageous both in triage of women with equivocal abnormal cytology, in surveillance after treatment of cin lesions and in primary screening of women aged 30 years or older. s15: however, the possible advantages offered by hpv-based screening require a well organised program with good compliance with screening and triage policies. s16: this article forms part of a special supplement entitled "comprehensive control of hpv infections and related diseases" vaccine volume 30, supplement 5, 2012. 	true 7 8

<s> claim:Propriospinal interneurons that play a role in the plastic reorganization of spinal circuits are integral for recovery from spinal cord injury. title: Recovery of supraspinal control of stepping via indirect propriospinal relay connections after spinal cord injury s0: spinal cord injuries (scis) in humans and experimental animals are often associated with varying degrees of spontaneous functional recovery during the first months after injury. s1: such recovery is widely attributed to axons spared from injury that descend from the brain and bypass incomplete lesions, but its mechanisms are uncertain. s2: to investigate the neural basis of spontaneous recovery, we used kinematic, physiological and anatomical analyses to evaluate mice with various combinations of spatially and temporally separated lateral hemisections with or without the excitotoxic ablation of intrinsic spinal cord neurons. s3: we show that propriospinal relay connections that bypass one or more injury sites are able to mediate spontaneous functional recovery and supraspinal control of stepping, even when there has been essentially total and irreversible interruption of long descending supraspinal pathways in mice. s4: our findings show that pronounced functional recovery can occur after severe sci without the maintenance or regeneration of direct projections from the brain past the lesion and can be mediated by the reorganization of descending and propriospinal connections. s5: targeting interventions toward augmenting the remodeling of relay connections may provide new therapeutic strategies to bypass lesions and restore function after sci and in other conditions such as stroke and multiple sclerosis. 	true 3 4

<s> claim:RAD52 is involved in break-induced DNA replication (BIR). title: Mammalian RAD52 Functions in Break-Induced Replication Repair of Collapsed DNA Replication Forks s0: human cancers are characterized by the presence of oncogene-induced dna replication stress (drs), making them dependent on repair pathways such as break-induced replication (bir) for damaged dna replication forks. s1: to better understand bir, we performed a targeted sirna screen for genes whose depletion inhibited g1 to s phase progression when oncogenic cyclin e was overexpressed. s2: rad52, a gene dispensable for normal development in mice, was among the top hits. s3: in cells in which fork collapse was induced by oncogenes or chemicals, the rad52 protein localized to drs foci. s4: depletion of rad52 by sirna or knockout of the gene by crispr/cas9 compromised restart of collapsed forks and led to dna damage in cells experiencing drs. s5: furthermore, in cancer-prone, heterozygous apc mutant mice, homozygous deletion of the rad52 gene suppressed tumor growth and prolonged lifespan. s6: we therefore propose that mammalian rad52 facilitates repair of collapsed dna replication forks in cancer cells. 	true 6

<s> claim:RAD52 is involved in break-induced DNA replication (BIR). title: Human cancer cells utilize mitotic DNA synthesis to resist replication stress at telomeres regardless of their telomere maintenance mechanism s0: telomeres resemble common fragile sites (cfss) in that they are difficult-to-replicate and exhibit fragility in mitosis in response to dna replication stress. s1: at cfss, this fragility is associated with a delay in the completion of dna replication until early mitosis, whereupon cells are proposed to switch to a rad52-dependent form of break-induced replication. s2: here, we show that this mitotic dna synthesis (midas) is also a feature of human telomeres. s3: telomeric midas is not restricted to those telomeres displaying overt fragility, and is a feature of a wide range of cell lines irrespective of whether their telomeres are maintained by telomerase or by the alternative lengthening of telomeres (alt) mechanism. s4: midas at telomeres requires rad52, and is mechanistically similar to cfs-associated midas, with the notable exception that telomeric midas does not require the mus81-eme1 endonuclease. s5: we propose a model whereby replication stress initiates a rad52-dependent form of break-induced replication that bypasses a requirement for mus81-eme1 to complete dna synthesis in mitosis. 	true 1 5

<s> claim:Rapid phosphotransfer rates are correlated with histidine kinase regulator specificity. title: Using Structural Information to Change the Phosphotransfer Specificity of a Two-Component Chemotaxis Signalling Complex s0: two-component signal transduction pathways comprising histidine protein kinases (hpks) and their response regulators (rrs) are widely used to control bacterial responses to environmental challenges. s1: some bacteria have over 150 different two-component pathways, and the specificity of the phosphotransfer reactions within these systems is tightly controlled to prevent unwanted crosstalk. s2: one of the best understood two-component signalling pathways is the chemotaxis pathway. s3: here, we present the 1.40 a crystal structure of the histidine-containing phosphotransfer domain of the chemotaxis hpk, chea(3), in complex with its cognate rr, chey(6). s4: a methionine finger on chey(6) that nestles in a hydrophobic pocket in chea(3) was shown to be important for the interaction and was found to only occur in the cognate rrs of chea(3), chey(6), and cheb(2). s5: site-directed mutagenesis of this methionine in combination with two adjacent residues abolished binding, as shown by surface plasmon resonance studies, and phosphotransfer from chea(3)-p to chey(6). s6: introduction of this methionine and an adjacent alanine residue into a range of noncognate cheys, dramatically changed their specificity, allowing protein interaction and rapid phosphotransfer from chea(3)-p. the structure presented here has allowed us to identify specificity determinants for the chea-chey interaction and subsequently to successfully reengineer phosphotransfer signalling. s7: in summary, our results provide valuable insight into how cells mediate specificity in one of the most abundant signalling pathways in biology, two-component signal transduction. 	true 6

<s> claim:Reduced levels of lipolysis leads to higher P38 phosphorylation in adipose tissue. title: Activation of AMPKα2 in adipocytes is essential for nicotine-induced insulin resistance in vivo s0: cigarette smoking promotes body weight reduction in humans while paradoxically also promoting insulin resistance (ir) and hyperinsulinemia. s1: however, the mechanisms behind these effects are unclear. s2: here we show that nicotine, a major constituent of cigarette smoke, selectively activates amp-activated protein kinase α2 (ampkα2) in adipocytes, which in turn phosphorylates map kinase phosphatase-1 (mkp1) at serine 334, initiating its proteasome-dependent degradation. s3: the nicotine-dependent reduction of mkp1 induces the aberrant activation of both p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-jun n-terminal kinase, leading to increased phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (irs1) at serine 307. s4: phosphorylation of irs1 leads to its degradation, protein kinase b inhibition, and the loss of insulin-mediated inhibition of lipolysis. s5: consequently, nicotine increases lipolysis, which results in body weight reduction, but this increase also elevates the levels of circulating free fatty acids and thus causes ir in insulin-sensitive tissues. s6: these results establish ampkα2 as an essential mediator of nicotine-induced whole-body ir in spite of reductions in adiposity. 	unknown

<s> claim:Ribosomal protein (RP) expression is controlled in part by stress-activated regulators. title: Pathway connectivity and signaling coordination in the yeast stress-activated signaling network s0: stressed cells coordinate a multi-faceted response spanning many levels of physiology. s1: yet knowledge of the complete stress-activated regulatory network as well as design principles for signal integration remains incomplete. s2: we developed an experimental and computational approach to integrate available protein interaction data with gene fitness contributions, mutant transcriptome profiles, and phospho-proteome changes in cells responding to salt stress, to infer the salt-responsive signaling network in yeast. s3: the inferred subnetwork presented many novel predictions by implicating new regulators, uncovering unrecognized crosstalk between known pathways, and pointing to previously unknown 'hubs' of signal integration. s4: we exploited these predictions to show that cdc14 phosphatase is a central hub in the network and that modification of rna polymerase ii coordinates induction of stress-defense genes with reduction of growth-related transcripts. s5: we find that the orthologous human network is enriched for cancer-causing genes, underscoring the importance of the subnetwork's predictions in understanding stress biology. 	unknown 
<s> claim:Ribosomal protein (RP) expression is controlled in part by stress-activated regulators. title: The TOR signalling pathway controls nuclear localization of nutrient-regulated transcription factors. s0: the rapamycin-sensitive tor signalling pathway in saccharomyces cerevisiae activates a cell-growth program in response to nutrients such as nitrogen and carbon. s1: the tor1 and tor2 kinases (tor) control cytoplasmic protein synthesis and degradation through the conserved tap42 protein. s2: upon phosphorylation by tor, tap42 binds and possibly inhibits type 2a and type-2a-related phosphatases; however, the mechanism by which tor controls nuclear events such as global repression of starvation-specific transcription is unknown. s3: here we show that tor prevents transcription of genes expressed upon nitrogen limitation by promoting the association of the gata transcription factor gln3 with the cytoplasmic protein ure2. s4: the binding of gln3 to ure2 requires tor-dependent phosphorylation of gln3. s5: phosphorylation and cytoplasmic retention of gln3 are also dependent on the tor effector tap42, and are antagonized by the type-2a-related phosphatase sit4. s6: tor inhibits expression of carbon-source-regulated genes by stimulating the binding of the transcriptional activators msn2 and msn4 to the cytoplasmic 14-3-3 protein bmh2. s7: thus, the tor signalling pathway broadly controls nutrient metabolism by sequestering several transcription factors in the cytoplasm. 	unknown 
<s> claim:Ribosomal protein (RP) expression is controlled in part by stress-activated regulators. title: Exploiting the yeast stress-activated signaling network to inform on stress biology and disease signaling s0: healthy cells utilize intricate systems to monitor their environment and mount robust responses in the event of cellular stress. s1: whether stress arises from external insults or defects due to mutation and disease, cells must be able to respond precisely to mount the appropriate defenses. s2: multi-faceted stress responses are generally coupled with arrest of growth and cell-cycle progression, which both limits the transmission of damaged materials and serves to reallocate limited cellular resources toward defense. s3: therefore, stress defense versus rapid growth represent competing interests in the cell. s4: how eukaryotic cells set the balance between defense versus proliferation, and in particular knowledge of the regulatory networks that control this decision, are poorly understood. s5: in this perspective, we expand upon our recent work inferring the stress-activated signaling network in budding yeast, which captures pathways controlling stress defense and regulators of growth and cell-cycle progression. s6: we highlight similarities between the yeast and mammalian stress responses and explore how stress-activated signaling networks in yeast can inform on signaling defects in human cancers. 	unknown 
<s> claim:Ribosome-inactivating protein-2 (RIP-2) interacts with the p75 NTR death domain title: Gamma-Secretase Represents a Therapeutic Target for the Treatment of Invasive Glioma Mediated by the p75 Neurotrophin Receptor s0: the multifunctional signaling protein p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(ntr)) is a central regulator and major contributor to the highly invasive nature of malignant gliomas. s1: here, we show that neurotrophin-dependent regulated intramembrane proteolysis (rip) of p75(ntr) is required for p75(ntr)-mediated glioma invasion, and identify a previously unnamed process for targeted glioma therapy. s2: expression of cleavage-resistant chimeras of p75(ntr) or treatment of animals bearing p75(ntr)-positive intracranial tumors with clinically applicable gamma-secretase inhibitors resulted in dramatically decreased glioma invasion and prolonged survival. s3: importantly, proteolytic processing of p75(ntr) was observed in p75(ntr)-positive patient tumor specimens and brain tumor initiating cells. s4: this work highlights the importance of p75(ntr) as a therapeutic target, suggesting that gamma-secretase inhibitors may have direct clinical application for the treatment of malignant glioma. 	unknown 
<s> claim:Ribosomopathies have a high degree of cell and tissue specific pathology. title: Ribosome-Mediated Specificity in Hox mRNA Translation and Vertebrate Tissue Patterning s0: historically, the ribosome has been viewed as a complex ribozyme with constitutive rather than regulatory capacity in mrna translation. s1: here we identify mutations of the ribosomal protein l38 (rpl38) gene in mice exhibiting surprising tissue-specific patterning defects, including pronounced homeotic transformations of the axial skeleton. s2: in rpl38 mutant embryos, global protein synthesis is unchanged; however the translation of a select subset of homeobox mrnas is perturbed. s3: our data reveal that rpl38 facilitates 80s complex formation on these mrnas as a regulatory component of the ribosome to confer transcript-specific translational control. s4: we further show that rpl38 expression is markedly enriched in regions of the embryo where loss-of-function phenotypes occur. s5: unexpectedly, a ribosomal protein (rp) expression screen reveals dynamic regulation of individual rps within the vertebrate embryo. s6: collectively, these findings suggest that rp activity may be highly regulated to impart a new layer of specificity in the control of gene expression and mammalian development. 	true 5 6

<s> claim:Smc5/6 engagment halts the activation of SUMO E3 ligase Mms21 by ATP-dependent remolding. title: ATPase-Dependent Control of the Mms21 SUMO Ligase during DNA Repair s0: modification of proteins by sumo is essential for the maintenance of genome integrity. s1: during dna replication, the mms21-branch of the sumo pathway counteracts recombination intermediates at damaged replication forks, thus facilitating sister chromatid disjunction. s2: the mms21 sumo ligase docks to the arm region of the smc5 protein in the smc5/6 complex; together, they cooperate during recombinational dna repair. s3: yet how the activity of the sumo ligase is controlled remains unknown. s4: here we show that the sumo ligase and the chromosome disjunction functions of mms21 depend on its docking to an intact and active smc5/6 complex, indicating that the smc5/6-mms21 complex operates as a large sumo ligase in vivo. s5: in spite of the physical distance separating the e3 and the nucleotide-binding domains in smc5/6, mms21-dependent sumoylation requires binding of atp to smc5, a step that is part of the ligase mechanism that assists ubc9 function. s6: the communication is enabled by the presence of a conserved disruption in the coiled coil domain of smc5, pointing to potential conformational changes for sumo ligase activation. s7: in accordance, scanning force microscopy of the smc5-mms21 heterodimer shows that the molecule is physically remodeled in an atp-dependent manner. s8: our results demonstrate that the atp-binding activity of the smc5/6 complex is coordinated with its sumo ligase, through the coiled coil domain of smc5 and the physical remodeling of the molecule, to promote sumoylation and chromosome disjunction during dna repair. 	false 7
<s> claim:Sn is present on mature DCs during inflammation in vivo. title: Siglec-1 Is a Novel Dendritic Cell Receptor That Mediates HIV-1 Trans-Infection Through Recognition of Viral Membrane Gangliosides s0: dendritic cells (dcs) are essential antigen-presenting cells for the induction of immunity against pathogens. s1: however, hiv-1 spread is strongly enhanced in clusters of dcs and cd4(+) t cells. s2: uninfected dcs capture hiv-1 and mediate viral transfer to bystander cd4(+) t cells through a process termed trans-infection. s3: initial studies identified the c-type lectin dc-sign as the hiv-1 binding factor on dcs, which interacts with the viral envelope glycoproteins. s4: upon dc maturation, however, dc-sign is down-regulated, while hiv-1 capture and trans-infection is strongly enhanced via a glycoprotein-independent capture pathway that recognizes sialyllactose-containing membrane gangliosides. s5: here we show that the sialic acid-binding ig-like lectin 1 (siglec-1, cd169), which is highly expressed on mature dcs, specifically binds hiv-1 and vesicles carrying sialyllactose. s6: furthermore, siglec-1 is essential for trans-infection by mature dcs. s7: these findings identify siglec-1 as a key factor for hiv-1 spread via infectious dc/t-cell synapses, highlighting a novel mechanism that mediates hiv-1 dissemination in activated tissues. 	unknown 
<s> claim:Specialized functional cell types can be derived from human pluripotent stem cells. title: Complex Tissue and Disease Modeling using hiPSCs. s0: defined genetic models based on human pluripotent stem cells have opened new avenues for understanding disease mechanisms and drug screening. s1: many of these models assume cell-autonomous mechanisms of disease but it is possible that disease phenotypes or drug responses will only be evident if all cellular and extracellular components of a tissue are present and functionally mature. s2: to derive optimal benefit from such models, complex multicellular structures with vascular components that mimic tissue niches will thus likely be necessary. s3: here we consider emerging research creating human tissue mimics and provide some recommendations for moving the field forward. 	unknown 
<s> claim:Splenomegaly is observed in knockin mouse lacking the SHP-2 MAPK pathway. title: Dissection of signaling cascades through gp130 in vivo: reciprocal roles for STAT3- and SHP2-mediated signals in immune responses. s0: we generated a series of knockin mouse lines, in which the cytokine receptor gp130-dependent stat3 and/or shp2 signals were disrupted, by replacing the mouse gp130 gene with human gp130 mutant cdnas. s1: the shp2 signal-deficient mice (gp130f759/f759 were born normal but displayed splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy and an enhanced acute phase reaction. s2: in contrast, the stat3 signal-deficient mice (gp130fxq/fxxq) died perinatally, like the gp130-deficient mice (gp130d/d). s3: the gp130f759/f759 mice showed prolonged gp130-induced stat3 activation, indicating a negative regulatory role for shp2. s4: th1-type cytokine production and igg2a and igg2b production were increased in the gp130f759/f759 mice, while they were decreased in the gp130fxxq/fxxq immune system. s5: these results indicate that the balance of positive and negative signals generated through gp130 regulates the immune responses. 	true 1
<s> claim:Stacking is more stable when a purine is present in the +5 position (C1698). title: Decoding Mammalian Ribosome-mRNA States by Translational GTPase Complexes s0: in eukaryotes, accurate protein synthesis relies on a family of translational gtpases that pair with specific decoding factors to decipher the mrna code on ribosomes. s1: we present structures of the mammalian ribosome engaged with decoding factor⋅gtpase complexes representing intermediates of translation elongation (aminoacyl-trna⋅eef1a), termination (erf1⋅erf3), and ribosome rescue (pelota⋅hbs1l). s2: comparative analyses reveal that each decoding factor exploits the plasticity of the ribosomal decoding center to differentially remodel ribosomal proteins and rrna. s3: this leads to varying degrees of large-scale ribosome movements and implies distinct mechanisms for communicating information from the decoding center to each gtpase. s4: additional structural snapshots of the translation termination pathway reveal the conformational changes that choreograph the accommodation of decoding factors into the peptidyl transferase center. s5: our results provide a structural framework for how different states of the mammalian ribosome are selectively recognized by the appropriate decoding factor⋅gtpase complex to ensure translational fidelity. 	unknown

<s> claim:TRAP+ osteoclasts regulate mature osteoblast maintenance. title: PDGF-BB secreted by preosteoclasts induces angiogenesis during coupling with osteogenesis s0: osteogenesis during bone modeling and remodeling is coupled with angiogenesis. s1: a recent study showed that a specific vessel subtype, strongly positive for cd31 and endomucin (cd31hiemcnhi), couples angiogenesis and osteogenesis. s2: here, we found that platelet-derived growth factor-bb (pdgf-bb) secreted by preosteoclasts induces cd31hiemcnhi vessel formation during bone modeling and remodeling. s3: mice with depletion of pdgf-bb in the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase–positive cell lineage show significantly lower trabecular and cortical bone mass, serum and bone marrow pdgf-bb concentrations, and fewer cd31hiemcnhi vessels compared to wild-type mice. s4: in the ovariectomy (ovx)-induced osteoporotic mouse model, serum and bone marrow levels of pdgf-bb and numbers of cd31hiemcnhi vessels are significantly lower compared to sham-operated controls. s5: treatment with exogenous pdgf-bb or inhibition of cathepsin k to increase the number of preosteoclasts, and thus the endogenous levels of pdgf-bb, increases cd31hiemcnhi vessel number and stimulates bone formation in ovx mice. s6: thus, pharmacotherapies that increase pdgf-bb secretion from preosteoclasts offer a new therapeutic target for treating osteoporosis by promoting angiogenesis and thus bone formation. 	true 3

<s> claim:The World Health Organization's (WHO) data collection process is biased downward by unequal selection of larger outbreaks. title: Using Routine Surveillance Data to Estimate the Epidemic Potential of Emerging Zoonoses: Application to the Emergence of US Swine Origin Influenza A H3N2v Virus s0: background prior to emergence in human populations, zoonoses such as sars cause occasional infections in human populations exposed to reservoir species. s1: the risk of widespread epidemics in humans can be assessed by monitoring the reproduction number r (average number of persons infected by a human case). s2: however, until now, estimating r required detailed outbreak investigations of human clusters, for which resources and expertise are not always available. s3: additionally, existing methods do not correct for important selection and under-ascertainment biases. s4: here, we present simple estimation methods that overcome many of these limitations.  s5: methods and findings our approach is based on a parsimonious mathematical model of disease transmission and only requires data collected through routine surveillance and standard case investigations. s6: we apply it to assess the transmissibility of swine-origin influenza a h3n2v-m virus in the us, nipah virus in malaysia and bangladesh, and also present a non-zoonotic example (cholera in the dominican republic). s7: estimation is based on two simple summary statistics, the proportion infected by the natural reservoir among detected cases (g) and among the subset of the first detected cases in each cluster (f). s8: if detection of a case does not affect detection of other cases from the same cluster, we find that r can be estimated by 1-g; otherwise r can be estimated by 1-f when the case detection rate is low. s9: in more general cases, bounds on r can still be derived.  s10: conclusions we have developed a simple approach with limited data requirements that enables robust assessment of the risks posed by emerging zoonoses. s11: we illustrate this by deriving transmissibility estimates for the h3n2v-m virus, an important step in evaluating the possible pandemic threat posed by this virus. s12: please see later in the article for the editors' summary. 	unknown 
<s> claim:The ability of activator E2Fs in preventing cell death is limited to terminally differentiated cells. title: E2F1-3 Switch from Activators in Progenitor Cells to Repressors in Differentiating Cells s0: in the established model of mammalian cell cycle control, the retinoblastoma protein (rb) functions to restrict cells from entering s phase by binding and sequestering e2f activators (e2f1, e2f2 and e2f3), which are invariably portrayed as the ultimate effectors of a transcriptional program that commit cells to enter and progress through s phase. s1: using a panel of tissue-specific cre-transgenic mice and conditional e2f alleles we examined the effects of e2f1, e2f2 and e2f3 triple deficiency in murine embryonic stem cells, embryos and small intestines. s2: we show that in normal dividing progenitor cells e2f1-3 function as transcriptional activators, but contrary to the current view, are dispensable for cell division and instead are necessary for cell survival. s3: in differentiating cells e2f1-3 function in a complex with rb as repressors to silence e2f targets and facilitate exit from the cell cycle. s4: the inactivation of rb in differentiating cells resulted in a switch of e2f1-3 from repressors to activators, leading to the superactivation of e2f responsive targets and ectopic cell divisions. s5: loss of e2f1-3 completely suppressed these phenotypes caused by rb deficiency. s6: this work contextualizes the activator versus repressor functions of e2f1-3 in vivo, revealing distinct roles in dividing versus differentiating cells and in normal versus cancer-like cell cycles. 	unknown

<s> claim:The composition of myosin-II isoform switches from the A isoform to the B isoform during hematopoietic differentiation. title: Contractile forces sustain and polarize hematopoiesis from stem and progenitor cells. s0: self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells depend on asymmetric division and polarized motility processes that in other cell types are modulated by nonmuscle myosin-ii (mii) forces and matrix mechanics. s1: here, mass spectrometry-calibrated intracellular flow cytometry of human hematopoiesis reveals miib to be a major isoform that is strongly polarized in hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors (hsc/ps) and thereby downregulated in differentiated cells via asymmetric division. s2: miia is constitutive and activated by dephosphorylation during cytokine-triggered differentiation of cells grown on stiff, endosteum-like matrix, but not soft, marrow-like matrix. s3: in vivo, miib is required for generation of blood, while miia is required for sustained hsc/p engraftment. s4: reversible inhibition of both isoforms in culture with blebbistatin enriches for long-term hematopoietic multilineage reconstituting cells by 5-fold or more as assessed in vivo. s5: megakaryocytes also become more polyploid, producing 4-fold more platelets. s6: mii is thus a multifunctional node in polarized division and niche sensing. 	unknown 
<s> claim:The cytokine receptor which regulates chemotaxis and formation of lymph nodes is involved in production of myeloperoxidase in the left atrium. title: Myeloperoxidase acts as a profibrotic mediator of atrial fibrillation s0: observational clinical and ex vivo studies have established a strong association between atrial fibrillation and inflammation. s1: however, whether inflammation is the cause or the consequence of atrial fibrillation and which specific inflammatory mediators may increase the atria's susceptibility to fibrillation remain elusive. s2: here we provide experimental and clinical evidence for the mechanistic involvement of myeloperoxidase (mpo), a heme enzyme abundantly expressed by neutrophils, in the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation. s3: mpo-deficient mice pretreated with angiotensin ii (angii) to provoke leukocyte activation showed lower atrial tissue abundance of the mpo product 3-chlorotyrosine, reduced activity of matrix metalloproteinases and blunted atrial fibrosis as compared to wild-type mice. s4: upon right atrial electrophysiological stimulation, mpo-deficient mice were protected from atrial fibrillation, which was reversed when mpo was restored. s5: humans with atrial fibrillation had higher plasma concentrations of mpo and a larger mpo burden in right atrial tissue as compared to individuals devoid of atrial fibrillation. s6: in the atria, mpo colocalized with markedly increased formation of 3-chlorotyrosine. s7: our data demonstrate that mpo is a crucial prerequisite for structural remodeling of the myocardium, leading to an increased vulnerability to atrial fibrillation. 	unknown 
<s> claim:The deamination of cytidine to uridine on the minus strand of viral DNA can inactivate the viral genome by inducing G-to-A mutations. title: Broad antiretroviral defence by human APOBEC3G through lethal editing of nascent reverse transcripts s0: viral replication usually requires that innate intracellular lines of defence be overcome, a task usually accomplished by specialized viral gene products. s1: the virion infectivity factor (vif) protein of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) is required during the late stages of viral production to counter the antiviral activity of apobec3g (apolipoprotein b mrna-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3g; also known as cem15), a protein expressed notably in human t lymphocytes. s2: when produced in the presence of apobec3g, vif-defective virus is non-infectious. s3: apobec3g is closely related to apobec1, the central component of an rna-editing complex that deaminates a cytosine residue in apob messenger rna. s4: apobec family members also have potent dna mutator activity through dc deamination; however, whether the editing potential of apobec3g has any relevance to hiv inhibition is unknown. s5: here, we demonstrate that it does, as apobec3g exerts its antiviral effect during reverse transcription to trigger g-to-a hypermutation in the nascent retroviral dna. s6: we also find that apobec3g can act on a broad range of retroviruses in addition to hiv, suggesting that hypermutation by editing is a general innate defence mechanism against this important group of pathogens. 	true 3 5

<s> claim:The innate immune response struggles to remove small numbers of parasites. title: Partitioning regulatory mechanisms of within-host malaria dynamics using the effective propagation number. s0: immune clearance and resource limitation (via red blood cell depletion) shape the peaks and troughs of malaria parasitemia, which in turn affect disease severity and transmission. s1: quantitatively partitioning the relative roles of these effects through time is challenging. s2: using data from rodent malaria, we estimated the effective propagation number, which reflects the relative importance of contrasting within-host control mechanisms through time and is sensitive to the inoculating parasite dose. s3: our analysis showed that the capacity of innate responses to restrict initial parasite growth saturates with parasite dose and that experimentally enhanced innate immunity can affect parasite density indirectly via resource depletion. s4: such a statistical approach offers a tool to improve targeting of drugs or vaccines for human therapy by revealing the dynamics and interactions of within-host regulatory mechanisms. 	false 3
<s> claim:The latent infection of myeloid cells with human cytomegalovirus induces a number of changes in gene expression. title: Microarrays for the study of viral gene expression during human cytomegalovirus latent infection. s0: human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) is one of the largest known dna viruses. s1: it is ubiquitous, and following resolution of primary productive infection, it persists in the human host by establishing a lifelong latent infection in myeloid lineage cells such as monocytes and their progenitors. s2: most adults with hcmv infection are healthy but it can cause neurologic deficits in infants, and remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunosuppressed patient. s3: microarray-based studies of hcmv have provided useful information about genes that are transcriptionally active during both productive and latent phases of infection. s4: this chapter describes how to study genes in hcmv using microarrays and two cell types (productively infected human foreskin fibroblasts, and latently infected primary human myeloid progenitor cells). 	true 3
<s> claim:The latent infection of myeloid cells with human cytomegalovirus induces a number of changes in gene expression. title: Transcriptome analysis reveals human cytomegalovirus reprograms monocyte differentiation toward an M1 macrophage. s0: monocytes are primary targets for human cmv (hcmv) infection and are proposed to be responsible for hematogenous dissemination of the virus. s1: monocytes acquire different functional traits during polarization to the classical proinflammatory m1 macrophage or the alternative antiinflammatory m2 macrophage. s2: we hypothesized that hcmv induced a proinflammatory m1 macrophage following infection to promote viral dissemination because, biologically, a proinflammatory state provides the tools to drive infected monocytes from the blood into the tissue. s3: to test this hypothesis of monocyte conversion from a normal quiescent phenotype to an inflammatory phenotype, we used affymetrix microarray to acquire a transcriptional profile of infected monocytes at a time point our data emphasized is a key temporal regulatory point following infection. s4: we found that hcmv significantly up-regulated 583 (5.2%) of the total genes and down-regulated 621 (5.5%) of the total genes>or=1.5-fold at 4 h postinfection. s5: further ontology analysis revealed that genes implicated in classical m1 macrophage activation were stimulated by hcmv infection. s6: we found that 65% of genes strictly associated with m1 polarization were up-regulated, while only 4% of genes solely associated with m2 polarization were up-regulated. s7: analysis of the monocyte chemokinome at the transcriptional level showed that 44% of m1 and 33% of m2 macrophage chemokines were up-regulated. s8: proteomic analysis using chemokine ab arrays confirmed the secretion of these chemotactic proteins from hcmv-infected monocytes. s9: overall, the results identify that the hcmv-infected monocyte transcriptome displayed a unique m1/m2 polarization signature that was skewed toward the classical m1 activation phenotype. 	true 4 5 9

<s> claim:The microtubule-dependent delivery and secretion of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) is partially responsible for the disassembly of adhesion sites. title: CLASPs link focal adhesion-associated microtubule capture to localized exocytosis and adhesion site turnover s0: turnover of integrin-based focal adhesions (fas) with the extracellular matrix (ecm) is essential for coordinated cell movement. s1: in collectively migrating human keratinocytes, fas assemble near the leading edge, grow and mature as a result of contractile forces and disassemble underneath the advancing cell body. s2: we report that clustering of microtubule-associated clasp1 and clasp2 proteins around fas temporally correlates with fa turnover. s3: clasps and ll5β (also known as phldb2), which recruits clasps to fas, facilitate fa disassembly. s4: clasps are further required for fa-associated ecm degradation, and matrix metalloprotease inhibition slows fa disassembly similarly to clasp or phldb2 (ll5β) depletion. s5: finally, clasp-mediated microtubule tethering at fas establishes an fa-directed transport pathway for delivery, docking and localized fusion of exocytic vesicles near fas. s6: we propose that clasps couple microtubule organization, vesicle transport and cell interactions with the ecm, establishing a local secretion pathway that facilitates fa turnover by severing cell-matrix connections. 	true 4

<s> claim:The myocardial cell lineage originally develops from cardiac progenitors of exclusively endodermal origin. title: Human cardiovascular progenitor cells develop from a KDR+ embryonic-stem-cell-derived population s0: the functional heart is comprised of distinct mesoderm-derived lineages including cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells. s1: studies in the mouse embryo and the mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation model have provided evidence indicating that these three lineages develop from a common flk-1+ (kinase insert domain protein receptor, also known as kdr) cardiovascular progenitor that represents one of the earliest stages in mesoderm specification to the cardiovascular lineages. s2: to determine whether a comparable progenitor is present during human cardiogenesis, we analysed the development of the cardiovascular lineages in human embryonic stem cell differentiation cultures. s3: here we show that after induction with combinations of activin a, bone morphogenetic protein 4 (bmp4), basic fibroblast growth factor (bfgf, also known as fgf2), vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf, also known as vegfa) and dickkopf homolog 1 (dkk1) in serum-free media, human embryonic-stem-cell-derived embryoid bodies generate a kdrlow/c-kit(cd117)neg population that displays cardiac, endothelial and vascular smooth muscle potential in vitro and, after transplantation, in vivo. s4: when plated in monolayer cultures, these kdrlow/c-kitneg cells differentiate to generate populations consisting of greater than 50% contracting cardiomyocytes. s5: populations derived from the kdrlow/c-kitneg fraction give rise to colonies that contain all three lineages when plated in methylcellulose cultures. s6: results from limiting dilution studies and cell-mixing experiments support the interpretation that these colonies are clones, indicating that they develop from a cardiovascular colony-forming cell. s7: together, these findings identify a human cardiovascular progenitor that defines one of the earliest stages of human cardiac development. 	false 1

<s> claim:The proportion of people with visual difficulty is two times higher in low-income countries than in high-income countries. title: Global, regional, and national disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 315 diseases and injuries and healthy life expectancy (HALE), 1990–2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 s0: background healthy life expectancy (hale) and disability-adjusted life-years (dalys) provide summary measures of health across geographies and time that can inform assessments of epidemiological patterns and health system performance, help to prioritise investments in research and development, and monitor progress toward the sustainable development goals (sdgs). s1: we aimed to provide updated hale and dalys for geographies worldwide and evaluate how disease burden changes with development.  s2: methods we used results from the global burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors study 2015 (gbd 2015) for all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, and non-fatal disease burden to derive hale and dalys by sex for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015. s3: we calculated dalys by summing years of life lost (ylls) and years of life lived with disability (ylds) for each geography, age group, sex, and year. s4: we estimated hale using the sullivan method, which draws from age-specific death rates and ylds per capita. s5: we then assessed how observed levels of dalys and hale differed from expected trends calculated with the socio-demographic index (sdi), a composite indicator constructed from measures of income per capita, average years of schooling, and total fertility rate.  s6: findings total global dalys remained largely unchanged from 1990 to 2015, with decreases in communicable, neonatal, maternal, and nutritional (group 1) disease dalys offset by increased dalys due to non-communicable diseases (ncds). s7: much of this epidemiological transition was caused by changes in population growth and ageing, but it was accelerated by widespread improvements in sdi that also correlated strongly with the increasing importance of ncds. s8: both total dalys and age-standardised daly rates due to most group 1 causes significantly decreased by 2015, and although total burden climbed for the majority of ncds, age-standardised daly rates due to ncds declined. s9: nonetheless, age-standardised daly rates due to several high-burden ncds (including osteoarthritis, drug use disorders, depression, diabetes, congenital birth defects, and skin, oral, and sense organ diseases) either increased or remained unchanged, leading to increases in their relative ranking in many geographies. s10: from 2005 to 2015, hale at birth increased by an average of 2·9 years (95% uncertainty interval 2·9-3·0) for men and 3·5 years (3·4-3·7) for women, while hale at age 65 years improved by 0·85 years (0·78-0·92) and 1·2 years (1·1-1·3), respectively. s11: rising sdi was associated with consistently higher hale and a somewhat smaller proportion of life spent with functional health loss; however, rising sdi was related to increases in total disability. s12: many countries and territories in central america and eastern sub-saharan africa had increasingly lower rates of disease burden than expected given their sdi. s13: at the same time, a subset of geographies recorded a growing gap between observed and expected levels of dalys, a trend driven mainly by rising burden due to war, interpersonal violence, and various ncds.  s14: interpretation health is improving globally, but this means more populations are spending more time with functional health loss, an absolute expansion of morbidity. s15: the proportion of life spent in ill health decreases somewhat with increasing sdi, a relative compression of morbidity, which supports continued efforts to elevate personal income, improve education, and limit fertility. s16: our analysis of dalys and hale and their relationship to sdi represents a robust framework on which to benchmark geography-specific health performance and sdg progress. s17: country-specific drivers of disease burden, particularly for causes with higher-than-expected dalys, should inform financial and research investments, prevention efforts, health policies, and health system improvement initiatives for all countries along the development continuum.  s18: funding bill & melinda gates foundation. 	unknown 
<s> claim:The recruitment of Wdr5 to its target loci depends on Kat8. title: The histone acetyltransferase MOF is a key regulator of the embryonic stem cell core transcriptional network. s0: pluripotent embryonic stem cells (escs) maintain self-renewal and the potential for rapid response to differentiation cues. s1: both esc features are subject to epigenetic regulation. s2: here we show that the histone acetyltransferase mof plays an essential role in the maintenance of esc self-renewal and pluripotency. s3: escs with mof deletion lose characteristic morphology, alkaline phosphatase (ap) staining, and differentiation potential. s4: they also have aberrant expression of the core transcription factors nanog, oct4, and sox2. s5: importantly, the phenotypes of mof null escs can be partially suppressed by nanog overexpression, supporting the idea that mof functions as an upstream regulator of nanog in escs. s6: genome-wide chip-sequencing and transcriptome analyses further demonstrate that mof is an integral component of the esc core transcriptional network and that mof primes genes for diverse developmental programs. s7: mof is also required for wdr5 recruitment and h3k4 methylation at key regulatory loci, highlighting the complexity and interconnectivity of various chromatin regulators in escs. 	true 7

<s> claim:The tip of the inner tube of the toxic type VI secretion system (T6SS) antibacterial effector in Escherichia coli (E. coli) is decorated with VgrG and PAAR proteins. title: A view to a kill: the bacterial type VI secretion system. s0: the bacterial type vi secretion system (t6ss) is an organelle that is structurally and mechanistically analogous to an intracellular membrane-attached contractile phage tail. s1: recent studies determined that a rapid conformational change in the structure of a sheath protein complex propels t6ss spike and tube components along with antibacterial and antieukaryotic effectors out of predatory t6ss(+) cells and into prey cells. s2: the contracted organelle is then recycled in an atp-dependent process. s3: t6ss is regulated at transcriptional and posttranslational levels, the latter involving detection of membrane perturbation in some species. s4: in addition to directly targeting eukaryotic cells, the t6ss can also target other bacteria coinfecting a mammalian host, highlighting the importance of the t6ss not only for bacterial survival in environmental ecosystems, but also in the context of infection and disease. s5: this review highlights these and other advances in our understanding of the structure, mechanical function, assembly, and regulation of the t6ss. 	unknown 
<s> claim:The tissue surrounding the granuloma in an immune cell induces an anti-inflammatory immune response. title: Inflammatory signaling in human Tuberculosis granulomas is spatially organized s0: granulomas are the pathological hallmark of tuberculosis (tb). s1: however, their function and mechanisms of formation remain poorly understood. s2: to understand the role of granulomas in tb, we analyzed the proteomes of granulomas from subjects with tuberculosis in an unbiased manner. s3: using laser-capture microdissection, mass spectrometry and confocal microscopy, we generated detailed molecular maps of human granulomas. s4: we found that the centers of granulomas have a pro-inflammatory environment that is characterized by the presence of antimicrobial peptides, reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. s5: conversely, the tissue surrounding the caseum has a comparatively anti-inflammatory signature. s6: these findings are consistent across a set of six human subjects and in rabbits. s7: although the balance between systemic pro- and anti-inflammatory signals is crucial to tb disease outcome, here we find that these signals are physically segregated within each granuloma. s8: from the protein and lipid snapshots of human and rabbit lesions analyzed here, we hypothesize that the pathologic response to tb is shaped by the precise anatomical localization of these inflammatory pathways during the development of the granuloma. 	true 5
<s> claim:Therapeutics receiving accelerated approval encounter a lower frequency of post-marketing safety events title: Postmarket Safety Events Among Novel Therapeutics Approved by the US Food and Drug Administration Between 2001 and 2010 s0: importance postmarket safety events of novel pharmaceuticals and biologics occur when new safety risks are identified after initial regulatory approval of these therapeutics. s1: these safety events can change how novel therapeutics are used in clinical practice and inform patient and clinician decision making. s2: objectives to characterize the frequency of postmarket safety events among novel therapeutics approved by the us food and drug administration (fda), and to examine whether any novel therapeutic characteristics known at the time of fda approval were associated with increased risk. s3: design and setting cohort study of all novel therapeutics approved by the fda between january 1, 2001, and december 31, 2010, followed up through february 28, 2017. s4: exposures novel therapeutic characteristics known at the time of fda approval, including drug class, therapeutic area, priority review, accelerated approval, orphan status, near–regulatory deadline approval, and regulatory review time. s5: main outcomes and measures a composite of (1) withdrawals due to safety concerns, (2) fda issuance of incremental boxed warnings added in the postmarket period, and (3) fda issuance of safety communications. s6: results from 2001 through 2010, the fda approved 222 novel therapeutics (183 pharmaceuticals and 39 biologics). s7: there were 123 new postmarket safety events (3 withdrawals, 61 boxed warnings, and 59 safety communications) during a median follow-up period of 11.7 years (interquartile range [iqr], 8.7-13.8 years), affecting 71 (32.0%) of the novel therapeutics. s8: the median time from approval to first postmarket safety event was 4.2 years (iqr, 2.5-6.0 years), and the proportion of novel therapeutics affected by a postmarket safety event at 10 years was 30.8% (95% ci, 25.1%-37.5%). s9: in multivariable analysis, postmarket safety events were statistically significantly more frequent among biologics (incidence rate ratio [irr] = 1.93; 95% ci, 1.06-3.52; p = .03), therapeutics indicated for the treatment of psychiatric disease (irr = 3.78; 95% ci, 1.77-8.06; p < .001), those receiving accelerated approval (irr = 2.20; 95% ci, 1.15-4.21; p = .02), and those with near–regulatory deadline approval (irr = 1.90; 95% ci, 1.19-3.05; p = .008); events were statistically significantly less frequent among those with regulatory review times less than 200 days (irr = 0.46; 95% ci, 0.24-0.87; p = .02). s10: conclusions and relevance among 222 novel therapeutics approved by the fda from 2001 through 2010, 32% were affected by a postmarket safety event. s11: biologics, psychiatric therapeutics, and accelerated and near–regulatory deadline approval were statistically significantly associated with higher rates of events, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring of the safety of novel therapeutics throughout their life cycle. 	false 9

<s> claim:Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of human MDS. title: The NLRP3 inflammasome functions as a driver of the myelodysplastic syndrome phenotype. s0: despite genetic heterogeneity, myelodysplastic syndromes (mdss) share features of cytological dysplasia and ineffective hematopoiesis. s1: we report that a hallmark of mdss is activation of the nlrp3 inflammasome, which drives clonal expansion and pyroptotic cell death. s2: independent of genotype, mds hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (hspcs) overexpress inflammasome proteins and manifest activated nlrp3 complexes that direct activation of caspase-1, generation of interleukin-1β (il-1β) and il-18, and pyroptotic cell death. s3: mechanistically, pyroptosis is triggered by the alarmin s100a9 that is found in excess in mds hspcs and bone marrow plasma. s4: further, like somatic gene mutations, s100a9-induced signaling activates nadph oxidase (nox), increasing levels of reactive oxygen species (ros) that initiate cation influx, cell swelling, and β-catenin activation. s5: notably, knockdown of nlrp3 or caspase-1, neutralization of s100a9, and pharmacologic inhibition of nlrp3 or nox suppress pyroptosis, ros generation, and nuclear β-catenin in mdss and are sufficient to restore effective hematopoiesis. s6: thus, alarmins and founder gene mutations in mdss license a common redox-sensitive inflammasome circuit, which suggests new avenues for therapeutic intervention. 	unknown 
<s> claim:Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of human MDS. title: Induction of myelodysplasia by myeloid-derived suppressor cells. s0: myelodysplastic syndromes (mds) are age-dependent stem cell malignancies that share biological features of activated adaptive immune response and ineffective hematopoiesis. s1: here we report that myeloid-derived suppressor cells (mdsc), which are classically linked to immunosuppression, inflammation, and cancer, were markedly expanded in the bone marrow of mds patients and played a pathogenetic role in the development of ineffective hematopoiesis. s2: these clonally distinct mdsc overproduce hematopoietic suppressive cytokines and function as potent apoptotic effectors targeting autologous hematopoietic progenitors. s3: using multiple transfected cell models, we found that mdsc expansion is driven by the interaction of the proinflammatory molecule s100a9 with cd33. s4: these 2 proteins formed a functional ligand/receptor pair that recruited components to cd33's immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (itim), inducing secretion of the suppressive cytokines il-10 and tgf-β by immature myeloid cells. s5: s100a9 transgenic mice displayed bone marrow accumulation of mdsc accompanied by development of progressive multilineage cytopenias and cytological dysplasia. s6: importantly, early forced maturation of mdsc by either all-trans-retinoic acid treatment or active immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif–bearing (itam-bearing) adapter protein (dap12) interruption of cd33 signaling rescued the hematologic phenotype. s7: these findings indicate that primary bone marrow expansion of mdsc driven by the s100a9/cd33 pathway perturbs hematopoiesis and contributes to the development of mds. 	unknown

<s> claim:Traditional reviews are biased in their interpretations. title: Systematic reviews from astronomy to zoology: myths and misconceptions. s0: systematic literature reviews are widely used as an aid to evidence based decision making. s1: for example, reviews of randomised controlled trials are regularly used to answer questions about the effectiveness of healthcare interventions. s2: the high profile of systematic reviews as a cornerstone of evidence based medicine, however, has led to several misconceptions about their purpose and methods. s3: among these is the belief that systematic reviews are applicable only to randomised controlled trials and that they are incapable of dealing with other forms of evidence, such as from non-randomised studies or qualitative research.   s4: the systematic literature review is a method of locating, appraising, and synthesising evidence. s5: the value of regularly updated systematic reviews in the assessment of effectiveness of healthcare interventions was dramatically illustrated by antman and colleagues, who showed that review articles failed to mention advances in treatment identified by an updated systematic review.1  it is nearly a quarter of a century since gene glass coined the term "meta-analysis" to refer to the quantitative synthesis of the results of primary studies.2 the importance of making explicit efforts to limit bias in the review of literature, however, has been emphasised by social scientists at least since the 1960s.3 in recent years systematic reviews have found an important role in health services research, and the growing interest in evidence based approaches to decision making makes it likely that their use will increase. s6: not everybody accepts that systematic reviews are necessary or desirable, and as one moves further away from the clinical applications of systematic reviews cynicism about their utility grows. s7: several arguments are commonly used to reject a wider role for systematic reviews, and these arguments are often based on major misconceptions about the history, purpose, methods, and uses of systematic reviews. s8: i have examined eight common myths about … 	unknown 
<s> claim:Trans-acting factors, such as lncRNAs, influence mRNA translation. title: LincRNA-p21 suppresses target mRNA translation. s0: mammalian long intergenic noncoding rnas (lincrnas) are best known for modulating transcription. s1: here we report a posttranscriptional function for lincrna-p21 as a modulator of translation. s2: association of the rna-binding protein hur with lincrna-p21 favored the recruitment of let-7/ago2 to lincrna-p21, leading to lower lincrna-p21 stability. s3: under reduced hur levels, lincrna-p21 accumulated in human cervical carcinoma hela cells, increasing its association with junb and ctnnb1 mrnas and selectively lowering their translation. s4: with elevated hur, lincrna-p21 levels declined, which in turn derepressed junb and β-catenin translation and increased the levels of these proteins. s5: we propose that hur controls translation of a subset of target mrnas by influencing lincrna-p21 levels. s6: our findings uncover a role for lincrna as a posttranscriptional inhibitor of translation. 	true 1 3 4 5 6
<s> claim:Transcription factor EB induces transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages infected with Staphylococcus aureus. title: Innate host defense requires TFEB-mediated transcription of cytoprotective and antimicrobial genes. s0: animal host defense against infection requires the expression of defense genes at the right place and the right time. s1: understanding such tight control of host defense requires the elucidation of the transcription factors involved. s2: by using an unbiased approach in the model caenorhabditis elegans, we discovered that hlh-30 (known as tfeb in mammals) is a key transcription factor for host defense. s3: hlh-30 was activated shortly after staphylococcus aureus infection, and drove the expression of close to 80% of the host response, including antimicrobial and autophagy genes that were essential for host tolerance of infection. s4: tfeb was also rapidly activated in murine macrophages upon s. aureus infection and was required for proper transcriptional induction of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. s5: thus, our data suggest that tfeb is a previously unappreciated, evolutionarily ancient transcription factor in the host response to infection. 	true 4

<s> claim:Type 1 Diabetes is associated with subtle perturbations in T reg development. title: Type 1 diabetes-associated IL2RA variation lowers IL-2 signaling and contributes to diminished CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cell function. s0: numerous reports have demonstrated that cd4(+)cd25(+) regulatory t cells (tregs) from individuals with a range of human autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes, are deficient in their ability to control autologous proinflammatory responses when compared with nondiseased, control individuals. s1: treg dysfunction could be a primary, causal event or may result from perturbations in the immune system during disease development. s2: polymorphisms in genes associated with treg function, such as il2ra, confer a higher risk of autoimmune disease. s3: although this suggests a primary role for defective tregs in autoimmunity, a link between il2ra gene polymorphisms and treg function has not been examined. s4: we addressed this by examining the impact of an il2ra haplotype associated with type 1 diabetes on treg fitness and suppressive function. s5: studies were conducted using healthy human subjects to avoid any confounding effects of disease. s6: we demonstrated that the presence of an autoimmune disease-associated il2ra haplotype correlates with diminished il-2 responsiveness in ag-experienced cd4(+) t cells, as measured by phosphorylation of stat5a, and is associated with lower levels of foxp3 expression by tregs and a reduction in their ability to suppress proliferation of autologous effector t cells. s7: these data offer a rationale that contributes to the molecular and cellular mechanisms through which polymorphisms in the il-2ra gene affect immune regulation, and consequently upon susceptibility to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. 	true 0

<s> claim:Understanding epigenetic regulation of replication is essential for the reational design of episomally replicating vectors. title: Global Reorganization of Replication Domains During Embryonic Stem Cell Differentiation s0: dna replication in mammals is regulated via the coordinate firing of clusters of replicons that duplicate megabase-sized chromosome segments at specific times during s-phase. s1: cytogenetic studies show that these "replicon clusters" coalesce as subchromosomal units that persist through multiple cell generations, but the molecular boundaries of such units have remained elusive. s2: moreover, the extent to which changes in replication timing occur during differentiation and their relationship to transcription changes has not been rigorously investigated. s3: we have constructed high-resolution replication-timing profiles in mouse embryonic stem cells (mescs) before and after differentiation to neural precursor cells. s4: we demonstrate that chromosomes can be segmented into multimegabase domains of coordinate replication, which we call "replication domains," separated by transition regions whose replication kinetics are consistent with large originless segments. s5: the molecular boundaries of replication domains are remarkably well conserved between distantly related esc lines and induced pluripotent stem cells. s6: unexpectedly, esc differentiation was accompanied by the consolidation of smaller differentially replicating domains into larger coordinately replicated units whose replication time was more aligned to isochore gc content and the density of line-1 transposable elements, but not gene density. s7: replication-timing changes were coordinated with transcription changes for weak promoters more than strong promoters, and were accompanied by rearrangements in subnuclear position. s8: we conclude that replication profiles are cell-type specific, and changes in these profiles reveal chromosome segments that undergo large changes in organization during differentiation. s9: moreover, smaller replication domains and a higher density of timing transition regions that interrupt isochore replication timing define a novel characteristic of the pluripotent state. 	unknown 
<s> claim:Up-regulation of the p53 pathway and related molecular events speeds cancer progression. title: Senescent Cells, Tumor Suppression, and Organismal Aging: Good Citizens, Bad Neighbors s0: cells from organisms with renewable tissues can permanently withdraw from the cell cycle in response to diverse stress, including dysfunctional telomeres, dna damage, strong mitogenic signals, and disrupted chromatin. s1: this response, termed cellular senescence, is controlled by the p53 and rb tumor suppressor proteins and constitutes a potent anticancer mechanism. s2: nonetheless, senescent cells acquire phenotypic changes that may contribute to aging and certain age-related diseases, including late-life cancer. s3: thus, the senescence response may be antagonistically pleiotropic, promoting early-life survival by curtailing the development of cancer but eventually limiting longevity as dysfunctional senescent cells accumulate. 	unknown

<s> claim:Urbanization is an important risk factor related to the transmission of dengue fever. title: Spatial and Temporal Clustering of Dengue Virus Transmission in Thai Villages s0: background transmission of dengue viruses (denv), the leading cause of arboviral disease worldwide, is known to vary through time and space, likely owing to a combination of factors related to the human host, virus, mosquito vector, and environment. s1: an improved understanding of variation in transmission patterns is fundamental to conducting surveillance and implementing disease prevention strategies. s2: to test the hypothesis that denv transmission is spatially and temporally focal, we compared geographic and temporal characteristics within thai villages where denv are and are not being actively transmitted.  s3: methods and findings cluster investigations were conducted within 100 m of homes where febrile index children with (positive clusters) and without (negative clusters) acute dengue lived during two seasons of peak denv transmission. s4: data on human infection and mosquito infection/density were examined to precisely (1) define the spatial and temporal dimensions of denv transmission, (2) correlate these factors with variation in denv transmission, and (3) determine the burden of inapparent and symptomatic infections. s5: among 556 village children enrolled as neighbors of 12 dengue-positive and 22 dengue-negative index cases, all 27 denv infections (4.9% of enrollees) occurred in positive clusters (p < 0.01; attributable risk [ar] = 10.4 per 100; 95% confidence interval 1-19.8 per 100]. s6: in positive clusters, 12.4% of enrollees became infected in a 15-d period and denv infections were aggregated centrally near homes of index cases. s7: as only 1 of 217 pairs of serologic specimens tested in positive clusters revealed a recent denv infection that occurred prior to cluster initiation, we attribute the observed denv transmission subsequent to cluster investigation to recent denv transmission activity. s8: of the 1,022 female adult ae. s9: aegypti collected, all eight (0.8%) dengue-infected mosquitoes came from houses in positive clusters; none from control clusters or schools. s10: distinguishing features between positive and negative clusters were greater availability of piped water in negative clusters (p < 0.01) and greater number of ae. s11: aegypti pupae per person in positive clusters (p = 0.04). s12: during primarily denv-4 transmission seasons, the ratio of inapparent to symptomatic infections was nearly 1:1 among child enrollees. s13: study limitations included inability to sample all children and mosquitoes within each cluster and our reliance on serologic rather than virologic evidence of interval infections in enrollees given restrictions on the frequency of blood collections in children.  s14: conclusions our data reveal the remarkably focal nature of denv transmission within a hyperendemic rural area of thailand. s15: these data suggest that active school-based dengue case detection prompting local spraying could contain recent virus introductions and reduce the longitudinal risk of virus spread within rural areas. s16: our results should prompt future cluster studies to explore how host immune and behavioral aspects may impact denv transmission and prevention strategies. s17: cluster methodology could serve as a useful research tool for investigation of other temporally and spatially clustered infectious diseases. 	unknown

<s> claim:eRNAs influence is linked to senescence, aging, and carcinogenesis. title: eRNAs are required for p53-dependent enhancer activity and gene transcription. s0: binding within or nearby target genes involved in cell proliferation and survival enables the p53 tumor suppressor gene to regulate their transcription and cell-cycle progression. s1: using genome-wide chromatin-binding profiles, we describe binding of p53 also to regions located distantly from any known p53 target gene. s2: interestingly, many of these regions possess conserved p53-binding sites and all known hallmarks of enhancer regions. s3: we demonstrate that these p53-bound enhancer regions (p53bers) indeed contain enhancer activity and interact intrachromosomally with multiple neighboring genes to convey long-distance p53-dependent transcription regulation. s4: furthermore, p53bers produce, in a p53-dependent manner, enhancer rnas (ernas) that are required for efficient transcriptional enhancement of interacting target genes and induction of a p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest. s5: thus, our results ascribe transcription enhancement activity to p53 with the capacity to regulate multiple genes from a single genomic binding site. s6: moreover, erna production from p53bers is required for efficient p53 transcription enhancement. 	unknown

<s> claim:miRNAs enforce homeostasis by suppressing low-level ''leaky'' transcription. title: MicroRNAs can generate thresholds in target gene expression s0: micrornas (mirnas) are short, highly conserved noncoding rna molecules that repress gene expression in a sequence-dependent manner. s1: we performed single-cell measurements using quantitative fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry to monitor a target gene's protein expression in the presence and absence of regulation by mirna. s2: we find that although the average level of repression is modest, in agreement with previous population-based measurements, the repression among individual cells varies dramatically. s3: in particular, we show that regulation by mirnas establishes a threshold level of target mrna below which protein production is highly repressed. s4: near this threshold, protein expression responds sensitively to target mrna input, consistent with a mathematical model of molecular titration. s5: these results show that mirnas can act both as a switch and as a fine-tuner of gene expression. 	unknown
